R109QIZ2MRMIRV	547	4	"I have been using the kindle app on my ipad to read books for some time. Although this works really well, the size and weight of the ipad made this a tad uncomfortable. I couldn't really tuck it into a handbag much smaller than a tote bag. I had friends who really liked their kindles and I thought Id like the smaller, more manageable size. Out of the box, I had a really exasperating time trying to get it to connect to my home wireless network. After about an hour, I went online (on the ipad) and got some answers, several of which were quite informative. Obviously, I was not the only one with this issue. After resetting my wireless router and manually typing the IP address into the kindle; success!!! Only took about an hour and a half. Contrast this with my apple products which took about 5 minutes. Strike one for the kindle. Web browsing, both at home and on my work network is a little slow, but adequate. I'll find out when I use it more to access the web which will probably not be at home. Much larger screen size on the ipad or my laptop makes those a far more functional choice for web browsing. My choice of the kindle was primarily for reading. One of the things I like about the other kindles is the non-glare screen with the e-ink display. The fire, unfortunately, has a screen which more resembles the ipad, making it difficult to read in direct light and with numerous reflections on the screen. I have to say that I'm quite disappointed with the reading ease because of this. I was hoping that the fire had a screen like the less expensive kindles. Fingerprints are an issue with the fire also and this is no different from the apple products I own. Overall, I like the fire with the reservations in web connectivity and reading ease. I'm editing this review. I just returned from a cruise. I like to read on the deck. It was impossible to do this on this kindle. I should have taken the cheapie kindle. The only way I could read was to get in the shade.  Defeats the whole purpose of a kindle.urpose of a kindle."

R144UG1JRZW5SE	547	4	"Like many, I had high hopes for the Kindle Fire and after using it for a few days, here are my first impressions and why I had to end-up returning it.<br /><br />Size:  I really like the size, it fits into my hands well and can comfortably hold it in one hand.  (unlike the iPad).  It can easily fit into some of my coat pockets.  I would expect that next generations Fire's will be thinner and lighter, which still has a way to go.<br /><br />Color screen:  Colors are vibrant and good resolution, but not HD quality yet....<br /><br />Software issues:  The biggest aggravation I had with the Kindle is the total system lock.  The Kindle would \\""FREEZE\\"" on me at least once everytime I used it.  It would become completely non-responsive, to the touch screen or anything....just plain frozen.  The only way to unfreeze it was to do a hard shut down.  That was very aggravating and the primary reason wny I had to return it.<br /><br />Video Freezing:  Similar to the total device freezing, the video would also completely freeze on me 1-2 minutes into a video.  I have one of the latest Belkin N routers designed for wireless video, so I don't believe that's the problem.  But in any case, I could not complete a single video without complete freezing up.<br /><br />Apps:  Disappointed with the selection of the Apps....<br /><br />Also, too much of the experience seemed more about how I can spend more money on Amazon and less about delighting me with an outstanding experience.  This is opposite of teh Apple model.<br /><br />I am a big Amazon fan, Prime customer etc....and really wanted the FIRE to be a better device, but it ultimately disappointed me with the overall user experience....I'm in a dilemma now....spend more money for an iPad, or wait for the next gen Fire?"

R14V97DU6DN31S	547	3	"When I first received it in the mail (shipped very quickly), I was incredibly excited for it. I had a speck one and was immediately in love with this one more. This has features that the speck one didn't have-with its stand, it could stand vertically and horizontally; also, rather than just a peg to stand it up (only horizontally like my speck), it has an entire slot (I hope that makes sense). Also, it rotates. Also, it has an entire plastic backing rather than just 3/4 of it. It has some very nice features. The cover of it is thick so I felt as if my screen were protected. However, 2 months down the line, the thing is falling apart. The outside print (very cute and unique print I might add) is coming off from the hard plastic. the corner is chipping off, leading me to believe that in just a few months my iPad is going to fall out. In theory, it is an excellent iPad case. It still has features I really love, but as of right now, I'm not satisfied because its breaking after less than two months."

R15V7MC32Q3FET	547	5	"This is my update to my earlier review in which I noted that this &#34; tablet began deleting newly installed apps on reboot after a system update and this continued after a factory reset. Others cite the same problem at postings on the Lenovo Community website under the headings 'Idea Tab A8-50 (A5500) paid apps won't install' and 'applications won't install'. Eventually another user posted the fix on the Lenovo Community website which required installing the beta version of the Google Play Store software (at the time, not yet released on the Google Play Store) from a geek site that had the beta version. Neither Lenovo nor Google would acknowledge the problem leaving A8-50 owners on their own. This did fix the problem described in my first review. So with this fix, it's a decent tablet. Nice screen size, decent resolution, decent sound. Its biggest limitations are: 1.) its limited memory (16 gb). 2.) There is at least one Lenovo App installed that Norton has rated as a high security risk, a problem similar to that found recently on other Lenovo products.  3.) Lenovo still has not released an Android OS update, so the A8-50 runs Kit Kat rather than Lolipop, putting the OS several generations back. 4.) In that it's own software is a security risk, a somewhat antagonistic relationship with its customers. Because Lenovo still has not updated the OS, I can not recommend this tablet. Still, a decent tablet for the kids."

R1BVAQQ4HF9D2B	547	5	"As the iPad continues to have handwriting and note applications created for it, the demand for a high quality stylus will only continue to grow higher. I for one want to surrender my pad and paper forever. I use NoteTaker HD and found the Boxwave to be an OK product. First, it's only about 2/3s the size of an average pen. This makes it difficult to hold and clumsy. Secondly, the product lacks any weight which I personally feel doesn't provide the balance you need for proper handwriting. Next, it comes with a small plug to go into the headphone socket. While this is a neat idea, it's poor execution makes it virtually useless. Why not develop an attachment that stays on top of the iPad (like a holder) and you can snap the stylus in and out? In this case, you must have the little cord dangle while you write and then reattach it every time you put it down. Talk about a pain.     As for performance, the thin rubber tip does maintain contact well, but lack the precision I want from a writing tool. Compared to the other options out there, it's sad to say this may be your best option for now. Hopefully some product designer will realize ergonomics are important for function and long-term use. In the meantime, I'll have to continue using the BoxWave, no matter how reluctant I may be."

Honestly, you really can't tell the difference unless inspected closely. So if you are worried about mis-matched color or it not fitting...you won't have that issue with this battery.  Second:[Battery] The original battery for a 2008 era MacBook Pro would need to have the adapter connected the whole time. If not, it would shut down within seconds. So, I decided to get a replacement. Looking over prices and such I decided on this particular battery. Works and fits, but doesn't hold much of a charge. Depending on what I'm doing on the computer it lasts about an hour, sometimes less.   The computer is used mostly for CG (computer graphics) work and some gaming. Doing either drains the battery much faster than if I were just surfing the web or checking email. So, if that's all you will be doing (email and such) than you may be able to squeeze a little more charged up time from the battery.

What made me go for this keyboard was that there is a video link in the description that has a short video showing off this keyboard. If it weren't for that video I wouldn't have given this one a try. I just received it today and wanted to be the first person to say I am pretty impressed with this keyboard.  Firstly, I wanted a keyboard with dedicated multimedia buttons, not secondary multimedia buttons which most of the blue led lighted keyboards on Amazon had. This keyboard has dedicated multimedia buttons and they work great. Very big multimedia buttons and are colored red for easy distinction. Although, the led back light does not light them up like on the keys of the keyboard, they have lights that kind of go around them to at least see their border in complete darkness but can easily see them in daylight.  Secondly, the key ScrLk is labeled underneath it with a picture indicating it is the button to change the led lights from blue, red purple and off. Just hold the FN key down and keep pressing the ScrLk key for your desired color. Easy, simple and no guess work or trying to remember what key it was to change the colors. You can also change the brightness using FN + PgUp or PgDn keys. Easy!  Thirdly, the keyboards USB cable is braided. Nothing spells good quality like a braided USB cable.  Fourthly, the keyboard keys click very well. However, it seems the space bar has a tiny squeak when using it, which I hope will die down over time or I might take it out and get some Wd-40 in there to quiet it. The keyboard is pretty heavy with rubber feet underneath it to keep it grounded. Also has tilt option.  Lastly, the keys are very hard to see when the back light led lights are not on. This is obvious because the letters on the keys are transparent and are not black on white, or white on black. So in all honesty, in order to use this keyboard, either the back light needs to be on at all times, day or night, to see the key letters or if you took a lot of typing classes in your day you don't have to see the keys to type.  Some interesting things to know about this keyboard:  1. There are shiny red bumpers to the left and right of this keyboard. They light up very well with the red and purple back lights but the blue doesn't seem to shine through as good.  2. The keyboards back lights turn off after 3 minutes of being idle. I assume this is a power saving feature. Just click a key on the keyboard to wake the lights back up. It resumes the same light you left off.  3. When you wake the computer from sleep, the keyboard goes back to its default color which is blue instead of going back to the color you left off of unless it was blue. This is kind of annoying, Not sure why it just can't go back to the last color selected.  Bottom line, for the discounted price of this keyboard it is just pretty cool. Very bright led lights from blue to red and purple and to be able to increase and decrease the brightness I am satisfied. The reason why I rated -1 star was because the annoying squeaky space bar on a new keyboard (which I will have to take out and spray some lubricant in there on a brand new keyboard). Please feel free to check out all the pictures I uploaded of this keyboard.  UPDATE:  After further investigation of the squeaky space bar (it was driving me nuts) I popped the space bar off and to my surprise there were no 2x mini springs as stated on the back of the keyboard box making it a stronger keyboard. I quote &#34;The blank space key double spring design curved&#34; and has a picture of the spacebar removed and two mini springs are present indicating a strong double spring design for a strong lasting space bar. However, all I find instead is a traditional long bar spring which was used in the old school keyboards (probably still used today in cheap keyboards but definitely not gaming keyboards I would assume. Then again, I'm not popping off the space bar to check every single keyboard I purchase to see whats under the hood). And since the back of the keyboard box states, with a picture I might add, that it should have two springs in it, I have to say I have identified false advertisement on this keyboard and it must be reported. Not that the kind of spring in a keyboard is such a big deal but it makes the company untrustworthy and that puts me on edge. I plan to submit a picture of this, once Amazon sends me email instructions on how to add additional pictures to a review (can't seem to figure it out) in hopes that the sellers see this false advertisement and correct it. Also I appreciate a contact from the seller to arrange an exchange for the double spring keyboard that is stated on the box rather then the one I got. Because of this I had to take away a star. False advertisement is completely unacceptable. Sellers, feel free to chime in and explain your side of this. On a good note, the space bar is no longer squeaking and driving me nuts. The long spring bar must of been rubbing the wrong way.  Also, the picture of the keyboard on the box has blue multimedia buttons instead of red. And the small picture on the back of the keyboards box that displays the double springs for the space bar has a completely different design then the keyboard I got. The keyboard I got has a pointy arm rest below the space bar like shown in the sellers pictures. However, the referred picture shows a smooth arm rest which tells me they are illustrating the wrong keyboard. Maybe it was an earlier model but there are definitely no double springs under my space bar.  So after seeing the false advertisements I can only imagine what information is actually correct and what isn't according to what is stated on the tin besides the obvious. Does this keyboard have a waterproof splash design as stated? I have no idea and not sure how to tell other then to poor water on it and see what happens. There also seems to be two model numbers. On the box it states JLK009 while on the back of the keyboard it states MD-KB-02. Which is correct? No idea. Neither give me a whole lot to work with when I Google them. On the front of the box it states &#34;laser carving radium technology, never wear&#34;. Not sure how confident I am in that statement since the dual springs weren't there for the space bar. See what I am talking about? If I find anything else I'll update."

I can enter numbers directly into the computer or I can put it into calc mode, do the math, and then send the results to the computer. It also has a memory function like a regular calculator 2. I can use the Num Lock to navigate around the computer screen.<br />  I would love the product, but it has two huge flaws. 1. As almost every reviewer has stated, it falls asleep. I also ask the question: WHY? It happens so often that it makes the product almost useless. I can always get it to turn back on, but I haven't learned yet which key to push. If it is going to go into sleep mode, I should be able to awake it by touching any key. 2. It is too small. Think of this as a calculator, not a keypad. I cannot comfortablely use it the way I can a keypad because the keys are too close together.<br />  I do need a keypad. I wish I had ordered something else, but I doubt it is worth paying the shipping cost of having it returned."

R1Q23WZSVIZ0GB	547	2	"I would give this little laptop 5 stars if it weren't for the problem with adware.  I mean there were pop ups ever few seconds and PC Cleaner is the worst.  I called customer service and asked them if they put this adware on the computer with &#34;intent&#34;.  They wouldn't answer me.  They instructed me to return the PC to it's original configuration, which I did, and it didn't work.<br />I'm pretty good with computers, and I'm not entirely sure what the original &#34;cause&#34; was, but I'll tell you what I did to get rid of the problem.  I uninstalled McAfee and installed Norton 360.  McAfee didn't pick up any of the malware and missed one virus, Norton cleaned everything up.  It removed 6 potentially harmful files and now my laptop is working fine.  I had to look up PC Cleaner and the removal of all it's parts seems rather complicated.  I ran uninstall from Windows and we'll see if that kills all the ads.  If not, I will follow the instructions I found by googling the program.<br />I think this laptop would thoroughly confound a person without tech ability.  It's that confusing."

R1QIQDIITHLVEP	547	4	"I really wanted to give this a five-star review, but I can't. I only just put it on my new Kindle Fire last night, so I can't speak about how it holds up to scratches yet, but I do want to point out some basic issues:<br /><br />1. I wasted one protector trying to get it to firmly adhere to my Kindle. I had everything lined up and ready to go. I was following the directions exactly (which isn't hard). And as I was slowly placing the screen and removing the first layer of backing, I noticed that the protector, which was supposed to be sticking to the section of Kindle where I'd placed it, kept slipping. I had to keep pausing and trying to hold down the end with the exposed sticky bit while removing the rest of the first backing. Very frustrating. By the time I had gotten the backing off the first side and managed to keep the screen in place, I noticed that there were many air bubbles that couldn't be removed and were unsightly. So I removed the protector (something it says you can do), and I even did it carefully, but a finger smudge still resulted on the sticky side and it looked horrible. Into the trash went the first protector.<br /><br />2. I had more luck placing the second protector because I was now aware of the flaws and aware of what may result if I wasn't completely watchful. Now, the protector was clean with no smudges and my Kindle was ready for its case. This brings me to issue No. 2: The screen protector does not fit the Kindle Fire screen from edge to edge like my screen for my iPhone. This was pretty annoying because that made it difficult to line up in the first place, and it left a small gap between protector and edge of device all the way around. I don't have a thick, framed Kindle case; I opted for the book-cover portfolio for my device. So the edge of exposed glass around the perimeter of my Kindle is irksome. Also, being somewhat of a perfectionist, when placing the film I had to make sure the perimeter was exposed uniformly -- in other words, I made sure one side of the Kindle wasn't more protected than the other.<br /><br />3. Issue No. 3, for me, is that this protector screen is too glossy, it shows fingerprints faster and easier than the glass! I have a similar shield for my iPhone and I don't have this problem. It's very strange to me. I wish I'd researched more and looked to see if my iPhone screen protector company sold protectors for the Fire. When it's time to replace these protectors, that's what I'll hope to find. As it is, with me being a perfectionist, my portfolio pocket contains my lint cloth so I can keep the Fire clean. Constantly wiping the screen down is bound to get old, though, and I may simply request better screen protectors for Christmas.<br /><br />All of this said, the protector should do what it's meant to do, for the part of my Fire that it covers. No matter what, you shouldn't operate a device like this without a protector.made sure one side of the Kindle wasn't more protected than the other.<br /><br />3.

R1QM3764DZFO8W	547	3	"... because this is more of a 3 1/2 star item here.  First off, the price was good - $112 for a 22&#34; high def monitor is pretty decent - and from straight on, stuff looks very good on it.  Back-lighting is even and bright, and the colors are nice and vibrant.  The problem comes up when you drift off to the side and everything starts turning yellowish -- something my 22&#34; high def TV set never does.  To be fair, it's only annoying on a screen that is mostly white (like the review page here at Amazon) - with colorful screens it's not as obvious.  The other annoying bit is the buttons for the menu - they're some sort of touch sensitive thing, and they don't always trigger the way you want them to.  I also cant seem to actually adjust the brightness and contrast, I can only switch between &#34;normal&#34; and &#34;eco&#34; modes.<br /><br />Still, low cost, and quick delivery makes it better than the 3 I could give it..."

R1QWK7QAPOREL0	547	2	"I purchased this drive with some reservations - especially because a few reviews mentioned that the drive is loud.  It is primarily a backup drive for me, so it doesn't get the intense usage that other drives may see, but so far it has performed flawlessly.  It is quick and quiet.  My main drive is a Western Digital Green drive which is specifically made to be quiet at the expense of being somewhat slower.  Well, so far, this Hitachi seems as quiet, if not quieter, to me.  But it is definitely faster than my Green drive.    All-in-all I am quite pleased.  Perhaps I will reformat my drives sometime and use the new Hitachi as the main drive.    **UPDATE** After just a few months, the drive died and I had to send it in to get a replacement.  For that reason, I've lowered to 3 stars.  I realize that drives die, but this drive was only a few months old and rarely used.  It shouldn't die that soon, in my humble opinion"

R1R7W8IEJFSNZB	547	3	"First of all, I have a MAC but I do run windows XP from time to time using VMfusion. The included software CD that came with this camera was pretty much useless as the 'wizard software' could not find the camera. Also it is not clear in the manual but you do have to physically connect your computer to your router and the camera to the router to get started (you can go wireless once it is set up).<br /><br />For Mac users using and Airport Basestation. Go to Airport utilities (it is in your system preferences) and click on advanced. Click on 'Logs and statistics' and then on 'DHCP clients'. Now turn over your camera and look for the MAC address on the sticker underneath near the serial number.

I must state that the machine was delivered inside the USA by Amazon, as far as I know Amazon cannot deliver laptops outside the USA ad that is why I paid the freight. The Toshiba dealer in my Latin American country said something about the warranty: Perhaps the Toshiba warranty for the Qosmio is not valid in Latin America (I am confused now).

R1XHQIS4Y4Q83D	547	1	"Purchased two sets of these rackmount ears for SilverStone GD08 HTPC cases - 1st set December 2013, 2nd set in January 2014.<br /><br />I would give this product 5 stars if not for the hassle of dealing with SilverStone support. See below<br /><br />There are two versions of these rackmount ears:<br /><br />- 'old' style (which are what are shown in the images above - NO: G11215620): very solid, mount position extends front of case about 10mm in front of rack rails - I received this style from the first order<br /><br />- 'new' style (NO: G11215621): thinner material, different depth dimensions, and mount position recesses front of case about 10mm behind rack rails - received this style from the second order<br /><br />When I mounted both cases in my A/V rack, the case fronts do not align - they are off by almost an inch from each other.  This is unacceptable for my showcase 63U A/V/network rack.<br /><br />Both fit the GD08 case, have the same UPC, package markings, and dimensions on the package, although the artwork is different on the two different versions and matches the appropriate version included in the packaging.<br /><br />SilverStone verified that there are two versions and offered to replace mine through their RMA process.  However, I have to send it to them first and pay the shipping.

See below<br /><br />There are two versions of these rackmount ears:<br /><br />- 'old' style (which are what are shown in the images above - NO: G11215620): very solid, mount position extends front of case about 10mm in front of rack rails - I received this style from the first order<br /><br />- 'new' style (NO: G11215621): thinner material, different depth dimensions, and mount position recesses front of case about 10mm behind rack rails - received this style from the second order<br /><br />When I mounted both cases in my A/V rack, the case fronts do not align - they are off by almost an inch from each other.Ê This is unacceptable for my showcase 63U A/V/network rack.<br /><br />Both fit the GD08 case, have the same UPC, package markings, and dimensions on the package, although the artwork is different on the two different versions and matches the appropriate version included in the packaging.<br /><br />SilverStone verified that there are two versions and offered to replace mine through their RMA process.Ê However, I have to send it to them first and pay the shipping.Ê They will then send the new version upon receipt of the old version, and return shipping will be taken care of by SilverStone.<br /><br />For me, I will just buy a new set instead of going through the hassle of taking the case out of the rack and RMA'ing the ears, with no place for my PC while waiting for replacements.<br /><br />I hate that this turned out the way it did, as I was planning on purchasing at least two more of the SilverStone GD08 cases (fantastic HTPC cases) to mount some of my other PCs in my rack.Ê I am wary about doing this if I cannot be certain I will get matching rackmount ears."

So why take the chance that it won't be a great battery for the full price Apple charges? This battery is slightly smaller then my old battery, and is glossy. My black macbook is not glossy, so it does look significantly different. But since I don't operate the computer upside down, it doesn't matter to me. Also, because it is slightly smaller it has a very small ridge around the case where the battery goes. All in all, for the money I got what I wanted. Its not perfect which is why its not 5 stars. I will update with any issues I have in terms of the battery's life.<br /><br />UPDATE: The battery has 58 cycles on it, is at 85% health and bleeds juice a lot faster then my OEM battery.

Now my situation may be different since my mediaPC is tucked away in a closet next to the media room. So with that in mind, I can still use the keyboard in the media room within about 10' of the closet but anywhere beyond that distance and it becomes a paperweight. I may try getting a USB extension cable to move the RF unit closer. Also don't expect to be able to type 50+ words per minute on this thing. It's just not quick enough to keep up even if the signal quality is excellent. Therefore I give this a 3 out of 5 since it does it's job - just not well enough for my situation."

R24296LCKCSANR	547	4	"Is this stand worth it for you?  Maybe.<br /><br />I purchased this primarily for use with a 7&#34; tablet (Tegra Note), and it's sort of an awkward fit.  In landscape mode, the back support has to be really low to hold it up, to the point I can't get it at a very good angle.  In portrait mode, my tablet barely stands on the &#34;legs&#34; of the unit.  It's workable, and it can technically support my Galaxy S4 phone, but not well.  I'm betting this would be better for larger tablets, like the iPad or any 9-10&#34; tablet, but I'm not sure it's really good for smaller tablets.  It's okay, but more of a balancing act.<br /><br />The other major negative factor is a lack of buttons.  There are no on-unit controls, which I'm guessing is done because it's designed to have the tablet right there, and if the stand was more stable on my Tegra, I might not even mind the lack of buttons.  As it is, poking at my screen worries me.<br /><br />So that's the bad, but there's still a bunch of good.  The speakers are loud and the audio stays pretty clear even at max volume, you do get stereo sound (though the distance between the speakers limits the effect of the stereo), and the battery lasts a good long time.  This may be the best \battery life I've seen on a portable speaker.  The tradeoff there is bulk.  Since this is designed to be a hybrid stand/speaker system, it's larger and somewhat more awkwardly shaped than other speakers.  It loses some portability in this trade-off.<br /><br />Pairing is easy, though I could not get NFC to work.<br /><br />I would recommend this to people with a larger device who are going to use both functions.  The recommendation becomes shakier if you've got a smaller device or you don't really need a stand.  At the current price point, I'm not sure there are a lot of truly better speakers in terms of volume, clarity and battery life (all three, I could likely pick out better on any individual point), all serious positives in my book, but the lackof buttons (or stability for smaller tablets) and size of the folded unit should be considered by anyone purchasing this product.<br /><br />Still, having purchased it, it's become my go-to speaker if I want to play music without headphones, and I use it to listen to the occasional audiobook.  It's not an awful setup, but there is room for improvement."

My only issue with it is that I just recently purchased it in December and the back button has already fallen off. I don't toss my keyboard around, if it's not on my desk then it's in my bag.

R26UTHU1VQUSVU	547	2	I like the key board except for one flaw. This flaw alone drove me crazy and would never buy another one until this flaw is fixed.<br />The space key is so low and is activated only if you press it down enough. The front guard prevents you from pressing down enough unless you turn your thumb down and consciously press it thereby losing your rhythm in typing. I had to tape a couple of thick paper on the space bar to make it work.

R271IZ9YWXZUQO	547	4	"Initially considering a tablet PC, I instead chose this netbook for several reasons.  It's lighter than many 10&#34; tablets, has a 320gb hard drive compared to tablet storage limitations posed by microSD card technology.  A true keyboard (as opposed to the touchscreen or bluetooth keyboard for an additional expense) and the capability of using programs that I'm already familiar with completed the decision.  While tablets are the current tech rage, and while I do own a Nook Color, they have limitations that a full computer does not.<br /><br />Pros:  At about 1kg (2.2 lb) it's very light and easy to carry.  The hard drive can be replaced with a larger one should the need for more storage arise. The screen is easily viewed, with nice contrast and definition.  Processor speed and graphics acceleration are adequate for the requirements I place upon them (with one proviso).  Since this is a low-end netbook, I did not expect a gaming machine.  The keyboard, though compact, is easily adapted to (admittedly, my hands are on the small side for a man), and possesses a good keystroke and feel for touch-typing.  The Asus utilities are straightforward and intuitive.  The wifi is the most sensitive of all of my family's wifi devices (2 smartphones, a Nook and a Samsung laptop).  The touchpad, though a bit different from what I'm used to, is easy to adapt to and there were no hiccups in adding a wireless Logitech &#34;notebook&#34; mouse.  Audio quality...according to my 18 yr old audiophile twins, it's good quality when using earbuds. (Years of punk rock and other loud environments have left me with significant hearing loss, so I cannot give a first-order review on that).  The built-in speaker is sufficient that I can understand movie dialogue even with a moderate amount of home background noise, so should be more than adequate for people without hearing loss.<br /><br />Cons: Depending on your requirements and computer savvy, these could be deal-breakers.  First and foremost, the computer comes with Windows 7 Starter, the most basic version and its fixed 1gb RAM is not really adequate to the task.  At login, even with as many bells and whistles disabled as possible, the operating system requires 50-54% of the RAM, leaving 512mb or less available to run software.  This can be rapidly consumed by the browser or many other programs, at which point the OS starts swapping data from ram to disk and back (disk-swapping).  The slow HDD further compounds matters making this little netbook pretty sluggish in Windows.  My solution was to set up crunchbang Linux as a 2nd operating system and I use Windows now only for Netflix.  A Debian-based distribution, crunchbang uses about 102mb of RAM, leaving over 920mb free for programs, drastically reducing the need to swap between RAM and disk.<br /><br />The Intel GMA 3600 graphics co-processor is barely capable of handling Netflix and only then when HD is disabled (not an issue of concern with the 1024x600 display), when all is working well.  However, Intel has stated they will no longer be supporting this chip and there will be no Windows 8 driver released for it.  Both the Windows 7 driver and the Linux graphics module are buggy.  When displaying video (Netflix or watching an .avi or .mpg via video player), the entire computer freezes at irregular and fairly frequent intervals, necessitating unplugging the charger AND the battery to turn it off.  This freeze is accompanied by a loud buzzing sound from the speaker or earphones and it renders the power switch inoperative.  Bluray movies (via my desktop computer through the wifi and home network) are often unviewable as they overtax what appears to be the Intel graphics software (not the chip).<br /><br />That complaint is directed at Intel and not Asus and, lacking a TV at home, I cannot say whether the problems will carry over to viewing through the HDMI port.<br /><br />----<br />A 7200 rpm hard drive or, better yet, a solid state drive, would do much to speed things up in Windows 7, but I purchased this as an inexpensive, more versatile alternative to a tablet and don't plan on further expenditures.  Crunchbang's lighter footprint alleviates much of the problem, it's free (donations gratefully accepted), and less prone to crash than Win7 Starter.  This is not my first Asus product, nor is it likely to be my last, but it may well be the last Intel-based computer I purchase; I've dealt with similar issues from Intel in the past, particularly with laptops.  In contrast, my first AMD computer was put together in '87 and I've owned AMD computers extensively in the intervening 26 years, with virtually no such issues.<br /><br />Conclusion:  if your intended usage is mainly for more mundane tasks (word-processing, etc.) with sufficient power for web-surfing, Netflix and the occasional DVD via network or USB drive, this netbook is a decent choice, but has limitations.  If you have the interest in learning the installation, care and feeding of crunchbang or a similar Linux (not a difficult task), or have prior *nix experience, a dual-boot computer which allows you to select the OS to use at startup gives this machine some welcome boosts in performance."

R290ILIKC4XPQK	547	5	"I purchased these Dvorak keyboard stickers for my Sony Viao laptop. They are the correct configuration, so now I can easily look at the keyboard if I can't remember which key is which. That has been a problem for me with some of the keys I seldom use, specifically a few of the symbol keys such as =/+. So the stickers do what they are supposed to do. However, there are a couple of reasons why I am disappointed. One is that the stickers for the F/U and J/H keys do have a cut-out for the bump that lets me feel where to position my hands correctly, but placing the sticker so that the cut-out is in the right place meant the top of the sticker had to be trimmed away because it stuck out over the top edge of the keys. That's not that big of a deal, really, but the thickness of the stickers is such that I can't feel the bump on the key anymore regardless. That may be different on a different keyboard. But the main problem is that the stickers have a slick surface, and I just don't like the feel of my keyboard with the stickers on it. I much preferred the feel without the stickers. Also, my keys now have a shiny surface and have a glare in the light when I am using my laptop in bed. The glare is enough to obscure the lettering so that I can't read which key is which without tilting the keyboard this way and that. That's annoying. I wish that I had applied only the stickers for the special symbol keys that I needed and not bothered with the letter key stickers, since I know the letters by heart. Now, for someone just learning Dvorak on a standard keyboard, the stickers would be a great aid until you get to the point where you have memorized all the keys and are truly a touch typist. The stickers are certainly a very economical alternative to a Dvorak keyboard such as the Kinesis Advantage (which is fabulous, but rather expensive for a keyboard)."

R294CTCUK957FC	547	1	"I recently received and installed these speakers.  Sound is OK but nothing great.  I really just needed them for work since my laptop is used in a docking station so you can't hear much from the speakers on it while it is docked.  I will say that I have a pair of Creative SBS 380 speakers (also 2.1 configuration) that sound MUCH better and only cost me $3 additional.  I wanted to get another pair of the Creative speakers but they are no longer being made apparently and Amazon did not have any of the lower priced Creative models that looked half decent.  In any event, I am fine with what I got.<br /><br />One negative - shipping time on these speakers was AMAZINGLY long!  I hate to complain too much because I used the free Super Saver method for shipment.

R294CTCUK957FC	Eddie	2	"I recently received and installed these speakers.Ê Sound is OK but nothing great.Ê I really just needed them for work since my laptop is used in a docking station so you can't hear much from the speakers on it while it is docked.Ê I will say that I have a pair of Creative SBS 380 speakers (also 2.1 configuration) that sound MUCH better and only cost me $3 additional.Ê I wanted to get another pair of the Creative speakers but they are no longer being made apparently and Amazon did not have any of the lower priced Creative models that looked half decent.Ê In any event, I am fine with what I got.<br /><br />One negative - shipping time on these speakers was AMAZINGLY long!Ê I hate to complain too much because I used the free Super Saver method for shipment.Ê In the past, everything that I have ordered via this method on Amazon has shipped within about a week at the most.Ê It took these speakers almost 4 WEEKS from order date to ship.Ê I was not very happy about that but this is not Logitech's fault of course."

R2AJSDV6CT19HG	547	3	"I like the portability and the ink is decent on the eyes.  Another thing I like is that when I purchase a book, I have it immediately and without a shipping charge.  There are a couple of things I don't like.  I still have difficulty getting it to connect to my hidden wireless network.  Tech support spent a good deal of time with me trying to make this work, but most of the time I still have to broadcast my network in order for the Kindle to connect.  My wife has a Nook and it doesn't have this problem.  I didn't like the fact that the Kindle was advertised at $69, but then I found that this price is good only if I wanted advertising, so I I ended up spending more.  I felt that this was deceptive and it should have been advertised at the actual price without the advertising.  I did not like that a power adapter and a cover cost another $20 for each.  In total, that's almost half again as much as the Kindle costs.  I felt that those should be included in the price.  Although I did have to buy a cover for my wife's Nook, it came with a power adapter and no advertising.  Also, I bought the Kindle because there are some trading books that are only available on the Kindle.  However, when these books have graphs, the detail is difficult to see on the Kindle, especially for someone my age.  For text reading, it is okay.  I'm still inclined to buy fiction novels in hard copy though.  Maybe I'll try a novel on the Kindle to see if I can get used to it.  Basically though, it does what it is advertised to do."

R2D8XWKJOBFJ6L	547	3	"I got this as an external keyboard for my Macbook.  I am a fast touch typist.  I tested it last night for the shift-key stickiness people have been complaining about.  Definitely no longer an issue, at least with the keyboard I received.  However, there is a peculiar lag when typing that I have never noticed with other external keyboards, e.g., Kinesis.  Is it hugely noticeable?  Well, I guess it depends on whether you pay close attention to screen as you're typing.  If you type quickly and watch, it's obvious.  It does bother me but I haven't decided how much; I suspect it will drive me crazy when programming but I've only used it for text editing so far.  Oddly, my older and larger external Thinkpad Keyboard with the numeric keypad doesn't have this problem but that's too big to carry around.<br /><br />The real problem is there is no Lenovo driver to control TrackPoint speed and sensitivity for Macs.  Its speed is directly linked to mouse speed in the preferences panel.  This is a shame, as the TrackPoint experience is not remotely as elegant as it is on a Thinkpad.  But, it does work albeit somewhat stiffly.<br /><br />So, bottom line: The physical typing experience is much nicer than using the native Mac chicklets.  (Mac keyboards are tolerable but I use external Kinesis keyboards at home and at the office; I type enough that I want a \\""real\\"" keyboard.)  I'll likely keep this but I'm not sure if I'll travel with it."

R2EHJI8Y5U8Z3F	547	4	"I bought this to try on my iPad Air while I wait for Native Union to release the Gripster Wrap for iPad Air. The Gripster is by far the most flexible stand/grip/case I have ever seen for the earlier iPads and when I upgraded from my Ipad 3, I was really missing it. This Solo stand does hang over the sides of the iPad Air by a couple of millimeters, but it's not a problem. It offers a lot of flexibility in both landscape and portrait orientations, and is compatible with the Smart Cover. This is a bit stiff and hard to rotate and move for changing the positions, and it definitely does not look as good as the Gripster. It lacks some of the comfort and elegance of the Gripster so I will most likely still buy that when it comes out, but this will tide me over while I wait.  Total weight of iPad Air + Solo + Smart Cover is 23.3 oz. I'll add a photo of the stand attached to the iPad Air.<br /><br />Update 5/30/2014 - After a lot of driving last weekend, I decided to go ahead and order the Gripster Wrap now that it is out. This SOLO stand is just very uncomfortable when used as a grip. However, now that I want to remove the stand, I cannot find instructions on how to take it off. The link provided in the packaging leads to a 404 page, and my emails and tweets to the company have gone unanswered for two days. It makes me wonder what they are hiding by not providing removal instructions. I will get this stand off today one way or another and try not to damage my iPad in the process. I'm taking a star off this review for the company's lack of responsiveness."

Amazing bass, not just for their size and lack of a subwoofer. Amazing bass and great across the whole range. BTW, I'm not into thudding, overpowering dub bass.  I like solid tight bass that doesn't muddy the rest of the music.Tight is the best description here.<br /><br />UPDATE: Sad to say, these haven't withstood the test of time.  You see, all of the above is true, if you are 10 feet or more from the speakers when listening to music.  The sound fills the room and is great across the board. The problem is, in my case, as is common with computer speaker set-ups, I am not across the room from the speakers. They are located on the corners of the table where my computer is.  And up close, they sound muddy, bass-heavy and unbalanced. In fact, the sound reminds me of bootleg records from the 70's.  If you plan to place these at somewhat above head level and at least 5 feet from where you listen, then I still would say they are 5-star.  For most typical computer-based set-ups, they aren't worth the money and, in fact, offer no advantage of speakers in the $50 range."

Having purchased Logitech's best webcam, I really expected there to be much better quality images. Instead, the images are 'meh'. The almost have a plastic look to them. I have tested this cam in bright, medium, and dark conditions all with the same results. It also doesn't have a left/right pivot like the C525. Only an up and down pivot which is annoying given that this is the higher end product. My suggestion is to save yourself some money and buy one of their mid-tier webcams."

R2OBYZJEPV9XKI	547	3	"I got this in the cyber monday lightning deal that went sold out in a few seconds and let me say that I wouldn't have been too disappointed if I had missed the deal now that I got this thing on my hand for a few days. First of all the screen is a bit too small for my taste and I didn't realize until after the purchase that amazon was selling the 1024x600 version not the 720p version that has been in most review. Second, the Windows 7 is slow, which is nothing new, but apparently I had expected a responsiveness closer to a smart phone, and Windows smart phone is not at all that fast by the way. I have a great suspicion that 2GB memory instead of the non-upgradeable 1GB could have made a great deal of difference in this manner. However, a mixed curse with Windows 7 Starter will limit the number of applications open at a time to total of 3 so 1GB is probably never going to be a problem just because of this self-imposed crippling of the OS. In this respect to the non-upgradeable memory, running full-blown WindowsXP is probably going to shoot you in the foot more than the Windows7 Starter. But on the good part the TV reception is great and the software works, albeit slow to respond in changing channels. Youtube video runs smoothly but since the screen is so short I found myself having to go full screen most of the time instead of watching within the window. The shortness of the screen also makes most of the real estate consumed by the toolbars in the browser to be very annoying, except for Chrome which barely has anything on the top. I guess if I had laid my hand on this item before I purchased it I wouldn't have been too eager to click on the lightning deal, but for the price I don't think I could claim it as a terribly poor machine although I would gladly spring another $100 for the larger resolution and 2GB memory and then it would be just perfect. For now, this is great as a quick companion for emergency use on the road when the regular laptop is just a bit too muchhassle to lug around."

However, having used this for a month now, I see that the elastic band is starting to slack a bit (it is not as taut as it was when it was new and fresh). It still does the job, but am hoping that it does not slack off anymore. Another little thing is that using the arrow key (right direction) becomes a bit constrained with the cover."

R2OIL5XD9GIGKB	547	2	"I am so conflicted here. I LOVED this e-reader. I bought it to compare with the Voyage and found that for the cost of the Voyage, the Paperwhite was worth the purchase over the Voyage. I used it for about a week which was all I could stand as it had two blown pixels. I returned it for a 2nd. The second came with a blown pixel. I returned that one and will wait for the next generation. I'm really disappointed as I loved the reader, but the blown pixels were just too distracting and the Voyage is just too expensive and has nothing that the average reader would be bothered by. I actually preferred the color of the Paperwhite to the color of the Voyage. The Voyage was less white as I found the color of the Paperwhite to be much easier to read at all brightness levels. The Paperwhite has fewer lights at the bottom, so there are small gray (hardly noticeable unless pointing them out) compared to the Voyage. I would totally buy this again if the blown pixel thing could not happen."

But be aware that the screen protector design causes the touch sensitivity to change and sometimes not register swipes or touches properly. When trying to scroll in some situations it will instead register as a click (touch). The screen protector may show little dots in the sunlight etc... The case is top notch the only negative is the screen protector part.

R2R6I3K9FU3SJJ	547	3	"I have Verizon FIOS with the Actiontec MI424-WR that has 'G' wireless that Vz thinks is perfectly fine looking to the future and has no plans to upgrade. I can't just change it out because that router has the coax connection that distributes the on-screen channel/program guide to a couple HD-dvr's and an HD stb. So that router and the broadband WAN connection is in the home office at one end of the hacienda. At the far end of the place is a collection of networked entertainment pieces -- TV, home theater ensemble, mega-changer juke box, et al -- some of which have both usb (which could take wireless adapters) and RJ45 ports, except for one box. Sony, bless their hearts, think that RJ45 ports are still the only way to go, and that's all they included on their otherwise excellent 400-disc Blu-Ray juke box that catalogs your collection automatically via Gracenote. What I really need at that end is a nice simple wireless hub, but nobody seems to offer something like that, thus the need for a feature-laden router-cum-switch with WDS.   After a couple evenings on the web doing the research, it looks like ALL brands drive their 802.11n customers into two camps -- those who love the products because the setup was easy and/or the thing has been stable in operation, and those who hate the products because the setup was a nightmare and/or the thing has been unstable from day 1 or perhaps was stable for awhile but now it's not.  So, why am I choosing Trendnet? Well, it started with the generally positive comments from folks who have experience with the TEW-637AP. Then I just needed a router most likely to be compatible with that, thus the TEW-639GR. So they're shipping now. Five stars 'cause they can only go downhill from here. I'll try to remember to come back and report on the setup and operation later.  A comment (updated 11/2/2011) for those who have reported frequent connection drops: get the free app 'Wifi Analyzer' on your smart phone. It will help you with antenna placement and channel selection.  Post-installation update Feb 14, 2010:  So my application is somewhat oddball, but only a little, and so a top-down setup wasn't quite the right thing to do. A call to Trendnet hooked me up with Sean, an extremely knowledgeable and patient tech who got me going in the correct sequence adjusting settings so the TEW-639gr router would be recognized by the Actiontec router via the TEW-637AP, and I could hit the Internet from a laptop connected via RJ45 to the TEW-639gr thence wirelessly to the WAN over the wireless-n link we'd created. All of this was done while the two Trendnet devices were about 6 feet apart in my home office. Then I moved the TEW-639gr to its final location at the far end of the house, which is around 70 feet away straight-line, but 4 walls and quite a bit of furniture and other stuff apart in terms of intervening obstructions. Even with much fiddling with antenna positioning, and despite the successful passing of 1000-packet ping tests betweeen the Actiontec and the TEW-639gr, the performance of an 'n'-only link was simply dismal. I had to switch the pair to g/b mode, in which it covers this range with what we've come to expect as acceptable performance for streaming media. So, one star off for the inability to operate in 'n' mode over this relatively short distance. Will report back if any issues with long term stability or reliability.  Long-term update November 2, 2011:  My little WDS (Wireless Distribution System) network consisting of the TEW-639gr and a pair of TEW-637ap's has performed reliably in 'g' mode, but there's absolutely no way Trendnet has made these units to interoperate in 'n' mode with WDS enabled. Any single box will run in 'n' by itself, but no box will talk to another Trendnet box in 'n' mode. As late as May, 2011, their user guides continue to perpetrate this fiction. On the TEW-639gr, it helps to set the data rate to a fixed value, instead of letting it auto-negotiate, if you'll be streaming video through this box. 24Mb/s is plenty to stream HD video. No, a 'g' mode network will not support 54Mb/s continuous fixed rate. If you allow this box to auto-adjust the data rate, you will find your Netflix movie halting and restarting in a down-rezzed version frequently. Another star off Trendnet's rating for the interop problem. Eventually I'll be looking to replace this hardware with something else that actually does 'n'-spec."

R2RVHZTWR3GDF6	547	4	"This product is fairly decent.  I bought it in place of a laptop to make school easier since it is light and easily stored in a book bag.  Unfortunately, I have had a few problems with it.  For example, I have had many problems with it having programs and applications stop working, or I have had times where I am unable to select things on it.  I also, after just a few weeks of ownership, have noticed that the pre-loaded applications take up close to half the memory provided.  A real good description for it is that this device is everything a Android smart phone is, minus the calling and texting.  If I had known it was going to be like this, I personally would not have purchased it.  Over all, the price of this tablet and the matching keyboard came to just barely $100 less than the laptop I was considering.  This product may be right for someone, but not me since the Android phone I currently have has the same features as this and I really do not need two devices so similar."
R2RVHZTWR3GDF6	Eddie	4	"This product is fairly decent.Ê I bought it in place of a laptop to make school easier since it is light and easily stored in a book bag.Ê Unfortunately, I have had a few problems with it.Ê For example, I have had many problems with it having programs and applications stop working, or I have had times where I am unable to select things on it.Ê I also, after just a few weeks of ownership, have noticed that the pre-loaded applications take up close to half the memory provided.Ê A real good description for it is that this device is everything a Android smart phone is, minus the calling and texting.Ê If I had known it was going to be like this, I personally would not have purchased it.Ê Over all, the price of this tablet and the matching keyboard came to just barely $100 less than the laptop I was considering.Ê This product may be right for someone, but not me since the Android phone I currently have has the same features as this and I really do not need two devices so similar."

R2S3I0JYCNGGKJ	547	1	"Just got this case today and wish I had read these reviews a little more closely before ordering.  The case is a good value for the money,  but as others have indicated here there are some usability issues with usability. First of which is the strip of leather above the home button interferes with any application being used in landscape mode that has onscreen controls just above the home button such as in the Outlook application. Additionally, as others have stated the back cover attaches only at the hinge side and  when using the handhold is somewhat saggy and loose feeling. Overall the case fits very well and seems to be of good quality.  With on 2 minor design changes this would be an unbeatable case for the price."

No noticeable stuck or dead pixels. Reflections are noticeable but not obtrusive in a bright room ( but much less than the Macbook Pro Retina screen which is still quite reflective & unusable to my eyes). Minus points for being widescreen 16x9 ratio though. 16x10 is still better for browsing & photo editing.<br /><br />Speakers are sufficiently loud and clear for watching a movie in a quiet room but not really loud enough for party music.<br /><br />The keyboard is quite usable with reasonable key travel & little keyboard flex though they do wobble a bit. From a low angle when lying in bed the led's under the backlit keys shine in your eyes. Thankfully the keyboard lights can be switched off.<br /><br />Negatives:<br /><br />As shipped the DB71 comes with 4GB of RAM and an old fashioned Hard Drive making it a bit sluggish in use. Doesn't feel much faster than my old XP Netbook in regular use.<br />Thankfully the ram is user upgradable & after upgrading it to the max of 10GB, windows seems much snapper. With faster SSD drives dropping in price that will be my next upgrade, should really be standard though.<br /><br />Screen Backlight bleed. you can see the leds along the bottom edge of the screen in dark scenes & can move the bleeding by sliding your finger along the very flexible bezel.<br /><br />The bottom cover flexes and if something heavy where placed on it it feels like it would deform. 1st Notebook I have had that gives me concern it would not survive sitting on the bottom of my carry on bag.<br /><br />the large right angled Power connector feels like an accident waiting to happen & could snap if caught at the wrong angle. Hoping someone comes up with a third party connector or extension cable.<br /><br />the WiFi has lower signal strength & is slower by 40% than my 3 year old Compaq Mini Netbook on 2.4ghz frequency.  Luckily my home router has 5ghz support & I was able to improve throughput by using that instead."

R2T6PFHNHFKHCM	547	2	Its an good tablet for younger users but it lacks flexibility as you cannot run Google apps and many others that are available on a regular android distro. You can sideload apps to some degree but cannot get hangouts working for example.  Also they disable ADB so you cannot root the device.  Also if you plan to use free time you have to have a separate parent account and a limited child account. Great for young kids but not so great for older kids that may not need as many restrictions.  Gets annoying as you may have to jump back and forth between profiles unnecessarily. The freetime is nice along with the warranty. The 8gb does kinda stink. In the end I would have to say great for young kids and less ideal for older.  If your kid Is older suggest a normal fire or nexus tablet.

They DO stand out much better than my normal keyboard's lettering did and I was able to see my keys very well.

If you're concerned, this did come with a sticker for every single key except my \\""Fn\\"" button.<br /><br />That being said, I've had mine for a little over a month now and my frequently used key stickers are wearing out: 'A', 'E', 'C', and 'SHIFT' now have white spots on the keys.  Soon it's going to look silly and I'm going to have to peel them off and work on getting rid of the adhesive residue, which I don't look forward to.<br /><br />Long story short: great if you use it on a keyboard for moderate use.

R2XIVPO3S5VPLB	547	3	"Pros:   I don't think you'll find a better budget KVM switch. It is very easy to setup. The software is quite simple; very basic/no frills.  Exactly what I expect from a something in this price range. The KVM switch itself is not cheap looking by any means. It's made of good quality plastic and the cables that are sent with it are pretty good too. It takes about 2-4 seconds to switch between PCs. Quite acceptable from a USB KVM switch. If this were a PS2 connection I'm sure it'd be much faster.    Cons:   It looks like it was designed to be smaller and take up less space, however because of the positioning of the ports the cables make this thing about 4-6 inches in diameter. I would have preferred it be wider and all the ports be in the back. Also, there is no way to mount it to a surface. So you're stuck with leaving it laying on your desk with the wires going everywhere. You could leave it laying behind your desk but I like using the buttons on top of it versus the keyboard. It also does not work well with my Logitech MX300 mouse. The scroll wheel works intermittently. All other features on my mouse work fine including middle mouse button click via the scroll wheel. I contacted tech support on through their online help desk. Their responses were professional but did take a few hours. They could not offer me any solutions and suggested I try a different mouse. A microsoft optical mouse works just fine. While they did not offer to fix the KVM they told me I would need to purchase a different mouse.  No big deal, I need a new one anyway. :)    Summary:  Despite the mouse problems and the mediocre port design this is a very good budget KVM. It suits my needs and gets the job done efficiently. The age old question to the salesman is \\""Would you recommend one to your parents?\\"".  Yes, indeed I would."

After updating the bois it helped a little bit however to this day I still can't change profile settings in the bois because it will not actually implement them.

R2YJ1F64LHIEMJ	547	2	"The wireless Logitech headset overall is a good product. They are comfortable, adjustable, the mouthpiece is a good length, and I like the volume control on the right earpiece. I use it mainly as a communication device with my internet phone.<br /><br />I can hear the person I'm talking with perfectly, except sometimes they complain that they can't hear me. Even if I turn the input volume all the way up, they say that they can hear me better, but my voice sounds digitized at times. I wish the input quality was better. This could be because the device is wireless, not corded.<br /><br />FYI, I haven't yet used the supplied USB cord. I currently plug the USB antenna directly into a USB port on my computer. Maybe using the supplied cord to position the USB antenna at a different location would help? I need to try this first, before I can say that it will help."

R2ZB1SGH5QS185	547	3	"Because of the design of this unit, the suction cup will not come loose from the windshield no matter how heavy your tablet may be.  This is a great safety feature for your tablet.  However, because the arm needs to lay on the dash, it does move side so you need to Velcro it down to keep it stationary.  It's a nicely made plastic unit with several adjustment points.  I use it with a 1 1/2 lb. Asus 10.1 inch Transformer Tablet and it holds it nicely but with some vibration over rough roads.  I now have a 10 inch navigation device with weather, traffic, gas prices, rest areas and music, all at my finger tips."

R31X4DVQWV2FUK	547	5	"I'm not as impressed as I had hoped I'd be with this cover after waiting so long for it.  The purple cover I purchased is a better purple in person, and I would describe the color as a little brighter than eggplant.  The cover attaches well and I like the centered light which is about the brightness I would have hoped for which is what bumped up my rating.  The device will stay securely in the back of the cover and is a great fit.  What I like the LEAST about the cover is the front cover itself.  It is lightweight, which would be great except that the cover is bowed and will not lay completely flat over the front of the Kindle like my old  Kindle 2 leather cover.  I have not decided if I want to return it yet.  I really wanted a cover with a light built in without elastic holding the Kindle in place.  I think the cost is too high with the flimsy top cover.  If it had elastic to hold it closed, I would probably be okay with it.<br /><br />------------<br /><br />After using the new cover for a couple of days, I've decided it is growing on me.  The top cover is still a concern for me, but if I'm careful when placing it in my bag everyday, my Kindle will be protected.  The light hurts my eyes unless I hold it at a steeper angle.  This is perfect when I'm working out on the Elliptical, but is going to take some getting used to when sitting in a chair.  I may need to prop it up better.<br /><br />Earlier, I said the cover was flimsy.  It is not flimsy.  It is stiff and lightweight.  It *seems* flimsy because of how it just flops closed and the edges don't lay down due to the bowing leather.  The lightweight cover is sturdy enough.  Overall, the cover is sleek.<br /><br />I would love for Amazon to tilt the light so the brightness from the bulb is not in my eyes at my preferred reading angle and for them to place some sort of elastic or magnetic closure on the side to make it easier to carry around and to get my mind off those raised edges.  I want to protect my device.<br /><br />Still going to keep it at three stars because the price is a bit steep, angle of the light, and bowed cover.cause the price is a bit steep, angle of the light, and bowed cover."

I decided to splurge on an expensive case with a nice window, because I figured I would have it for as long as there are parts running inside of it. I really love the way it looks and the window is gorgeous! When I got the parts for my build and the assembly was just about complete I realized it was going to be a nightmare to manage all the cables running in the back panel. The problem is that Corsair didn't put many slots or rings for pulling and tying cables to. The result was sub-par cable management, but visibility of the mess is minimal.<br /><br />On the other end, the front panel/dust filter of the case is just too brittle. The latches that keep it in place broke off of it maybe a week or two into actually having the case. I though I was clever and decided to super glue the latches back on. I guess I asked for it, but when I removed the front panel a few days later the latches came clean off. It is feasible to run the dust filter with out these latches since the actual clips haven't broken, but I'm afraid I'll break those too from poor leverage when dismounting the panel.<br /><br />There are a lot of cool features to this case, which is in fact a first generation. I think if Corsair gets another crack at this case then they'll get it done right. It's gorgeous and VERY radiator friendly and at the perfect size for a mid-grade build. It's the little design flaws that keep this from being a phenomenal case."

I think if Corsair gets another crack at this case then they'll get it done right. It's gorgeous and VERY radiator friendly and at the perfect size for a mid-grade build. It's the little design flaws that keep this from being a phenomenal case."

R36KE0VWSPW2H5	547	4	"The Creative Soundblaster X-Fi Surround 5.1 Pro is a high-quality, great-sounding external USB soundcard.  In addition to the drivers, the equalizer software is pretty top-notch and allows you to really fine-tune the sound getting piped out to your speakers/headphones.<br /><br />Two flaws, one small and one big:  first, the front of the device has a built in blue-LED light which I found frustratingly bright-distracting.  I'm kind of anal about my workspace, but I often work at night in dim light and the LED (device stored at head-level) often seemed almost laser-pointer bright, enough so that I eventually moved the Soundblaster to the floor behind my computer.  The 2nd problem - which I was surprised to see nobody mention - is that the sound card picks up audio interference from some usb wi-fi adapters.  I have no idea why this is, but placing the device anywhere within 2 feet of my computers USB wi-fi receiver caused it to produce crackling/popping sounds until I relocated the adapter. Just something to keep in mind; it may be that only my specific Belkin adapter has the effect.  It took several infuriating hours of hissing and popping in my headphones before I was finally able to decipher that as the source of the problem.<br /><br />Now that I have everything set up so as not to interfere, however, I'm really happy with the sound that this product generates."

R36KOUZXNK135	547	3	"I had trouble getting Windows 7 x64 installed (Vista too). Corsair's tech support over the phone gave me an email address, they never emailed me back.    The solution seems to be that the drive must be plugged into sata 1 or 2 and the motherboard must be set to IDE raid mode. Windows will not run in AHCI mode without a registry change, the registry key is HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\System\CurrentControlSet\Services\Msahci there is a key called 'start' the value was set to 3, changed it to 0, now Windows will load with AHCI enabled on the motherboard (ahci allows for hot swapping of sata drives).  I was using a sata II drive for Windows, the windows experience index went from 5.4 to 6.9. with a very fast boot time. Linux Ubuntu x64 has a very incredible boot time.    Overall I am very pleased with the improvement of Windows performance. The seq read speeds have benchmarked (using Crystal Disk Mark 3) at 220.9 MB/s, the write speeds are not a high as a more expensive drive, 107 MB/s,. For the price with the rebate (if it comes) it is well worth it tho.    The other reviewer was having trouble with the drive, I have not had that issue of the drive needing to be unplugged for the bios to see it.    Only 3 stars because Corsair's tech support seems non existent."

I spend a lot of computer time sitting down, and it would be a relief to do some work standing up.<br />Unlike most arms out there, this one can have both arms swing up or down independently, thereby doulbing the height extension without adjusting a lever or screw at back of the monitor. It almost achieved my intented purpose. I'm 5'-5&#34; and at maximum height, it's about 3&#34; short from the ideal height I want it to be. The specs drawings shows 23.23&#34; max. height. I can only achieve about 21.5&#34; maximum, so about 1.75&#34; short. That would have been a big difference.<br />It's not the most expensive, but definitely not cheap either. I was considering Ergotron sit-stand solutions, but they were too expensive and impractical (the adjustable desk) for me.<br />The construction is solid. I mounted a 27&#34; Viewsonic LED monitor with built-in speakers, no problem. The tension settings are midway, so there's still a lot of weight capacity left.<br />The second main problem I had is the tilt adjustment. Once the tilt is set with the allen wrench, it can only be adjusted by using the allen wrench again. I thought that I could tilt it more when you're standing up, as that would have compensated for the few inches in vertical height.<br />The third problem was the arm rotation at its base. I want to clamp it as securely as possible, but if you tighten it too much, the bottom arm will not swing around the base clamp. So I loosened it a bit, and I'm sure it wasn't designed to be like that.<br />The fourth problem was the slack in the rotation of the monitor around the vesa attachment. You could see there was too much freeplay at the pivot plates (1/32&#34;?). It was meant to allow the monitor to be horizontal or vertical. I tried to use it without the vesa 200mm adaptor plate, and the monitor would not stay level. The adaptor plate centers and balances the monitor.<br />Inspiteall its deficiencies, it's still a keeper, until somebody can come up with a better arm that meets my expectations."

Huge step back from the Kindle Keyboard. Yes I like physical keyboards, I  even added one to my iPhone!<br /><br />Amazon, are you listening, if you want to create the perfect e-reader for the next version, take the Kindle Keyboard & make it a touchscreen, and retain the ability to have landscape mode.

I had to bend the stem so the light would shine onto the Kindle screen and not at my eyes. It is was difficult to do, the metal stem is quite stiff. I wasn't even sure that was the right thing to do. It did not come with a guide of any sort. The light is very bright with new batteries but that doesn't last long as the batteries wore out quickly, about 3-4 hours of total use in 15-30 minute segments.

R3C5YCX5SQB9N8	547	4	"I bought this product to use with a Galaxy Tab 10.1\\"" tablet. Wishful thinking got me expecting complete functionality for the various buttons and the scroll wheel. The reviewers who've said there's nothing Android-specific about the mouse are right. Logitech says \\""for Android 3.1+\\"". This would be more accurate: \\""works with Android 3.1+.\\""<br /><br />What works... single- and double-clicking with either button or the scroll wheel: same result as you'd expect from single- and double-tapping with a finger.<br /><br />Scroll wheel: scrolls web pages, pages within a text editor, long scrolling lists within menus.<br /><br />Clicking and dragging: same as dragging with a finger.<br /><br />What doesn't work: Separate functionality for the left and right buttons? Nope. Left- and right-\\""tilt\\"" of the scroll wheel? No effect.<br /><br />The ability to scroll with the wheel is definitely handy -- likewise, the mouse's ability to target scroll-arrows and scroll bars precisely -- something that can be difficult to do with a finger. This precision makes working with web-forms much easier than it would otherwise be. (No luck dragging scroll _handles_, though. Oh well.)<br /><br />Flaws: The mouse pointer sometimes takes as long as 20 seconds to appear while a web page is loading. Why this would be, I don't know.

R3C5YCX5SQB9N8	Eddie	4	"I bought this product to use with a Galaxy Tab 10.1\\"" tablet. Wishful thinking got me expecting complete functionality for the various buttons and the scroll wheel. The reviewers who've said there's nothing Android-specific about the mouse are right. Logitech says \\""for Android 3.1+\\"". This would be more accurate: \\""works with Android 3.1+.\\""<br /><br />What works... single- and double-clicking with either button or the scroll wheel: same result as you'd expect from single- and double-tapping with a finger.<br /><br />Scroll wheel: scrolls web pages, pages within a text editor, long scrolling lists within menus.<br /><br />Clicking and dragging: same as dragging with a finger.<br /><br />What doesn't work: Separate functionality for the left and right buttons? Nope. Left- and right-\\""tilt\\"" of the scroll wheel? No effect.<br /><br />The ability to scroll with the wheel is definitely handy -- likewise, the mouse's ability to target scroll-arrows and scroll bars precisely -- something that can be difficult to do with a finger. This precision makes working with web-forms much easier than it would otherwise be. (No luck dragging scroll _handles_, though. Oh well.)<br /><br />Flaws: The mouse pointer sometimes takes as long as 20 seconds to appear while a web page is loading. Why this would be, I don't know.

It has to be pushed in very tight like something is holding it back.  Once in, it works fine until even a slight bump will dislodge it and power the unit off.

R3D2I9AGV74MGB	547	3	"my friend has this system and it sounds pretty good. For 82 dollars you really cant go wrong, although with my pair the right output sounded like it wasn't preamped. Therefore when I turned it on it sounded out of balence and there was no difference in sound between the right speaker being plugged in and it not being pluggedin.<br /><br />Unlike speakers I have had in the past the sub volume control not only effects the volume of the subwoofer but also the amount of sub in the 2 satallites. Franky it could be really nice or really anoyying depending on how you like your sound. For me having the bass down means someone is sleeping, not that I want to void all things below a certain frequenzy.<br /><br />Pros: Price to sound, sounds pretty good overall. Its sub-w is small so it fits into smaller locations. The sub being only 20W makes it sound you can definitly hear all of the different frenquenzys of whatever you are doing without being anoyying if you are in a dorm room or live with alot of other people.<br /><br />Cons: The cords between speaker and sub are kindof short which makes it a little difficult to settup if u have more the one monitor, the stretch will be difficult. The audio 2 didn't work for me unless there is a special way of setting it up in which you can use it that I dont know of (in that case leave me a comment please).  Also that the right speaker was broken and a replacement had to be sent.<br /><br />Summary:<br />Its okay, but for the money you could probably get the same sound out of a logitech set althought it looks cool and does deliver sound. Im not a fan of the way the bass is adjusted from both sub-w and the top speakers alike.  Depending on your settup and your preference on sound, it could be just what you need. But for the more vivid gamers it lacks the punch, and the drop from your dubstep music :P"

R3DEBF08QJHKNS	547	1	"I purchased to give as part of a Christmas gift with the Samsung Galaxy Tab 7.  While the product is okay, it was very difficult to put on, it just wouldn't hardly stretch, after using much muscle finally got the case on, at least it won't fall off!  The cut out for the charger needs to be cut with scissors, as the charger cord will continually fall out because the cut out doesn't line up with the slot, and taking off the case each time you charge the tablet is not an option when the fit is so tight. I was also somewhat disappointed with the seller as this arrived without packaging. I had purchased  2 and the other came in a package so it looked to the receiver of the gift like I had opened a portion of their gift prior to giving it."

The first con is that these things trap dust better than a case/cpu fan or vent, these things need to be cleaned out more often than you might think. Also, the fans on this item, for me, started making a lot of noise a few months in to the use of this item. Not having the fans installed is not a big deal for me because I use SSDs and the temperatures are not that bad given I operate the SSDs in a relatively cool ambient temperature, but ... Like I said, the fans are noisy or become noisy and this is a big problem, probably 4-5x noisier than anything else on my tower, pretty loud. The last con is the price, I could see justifying a price of 55$, but not 60+$, especially not the price I see which is 75$. This item is a good deal at 55$, at 75$ you are paying just too much, especially seeing as how you will probably want to replace the fans after a while.<br /><br />Also of note, the unit does not fit very well in to my case, I have a nicer case and I dont believe the tolerances on the case are an issue, however these were very difficult to insert and remove, and I think these guys should take a bout a millimeter or two off the dimensions of this unit to make sure it fits well.<br /><br />Final verdict, 4.5 stars @ 55$, 3 stars @ 75$.

I mean, how expensive could it be to develop and include a good track pad?? overall, laptop seems sturdy and reliable and I'm looking forward to using it<br /><br />update: an issue with the r705 series was that the fans would get really loud or that the laptop would get hot, but for either case, toshiba has remedied the problem on this model. the laptop stays extremely quiet even after I have been using it for 6 hours with just one break. it does warm up when in my lap on top of a blanket, but on a desk it doesn't heat up at ALL.<br /><br />4/25 I've had the laptop for two or three weeks now but since it's my backup/extra I'm really taking care of it and haven't used it that much yet. Mostly for school and not for browsing/videos pretty much. But one thing I noticed today was a little clacking noise that's from the chrome hinge, which is loose. I have no idea how it could have gotten loose as I've used the laptop probably less than a total of 7 times and it's onlybeen handled with the utmost care. REALLY annoying because for a $900 laptop, this really shouldn't be an issue.a $900 laptop, this really shouldn't be an issue."

R3INSM8HSOOV1	547	3	"My biggest complaint is the glossy screen.  Like laptop displays, monitors are showing up with glossy instead of matte-finish screens. The glossy screen can make dark areas of the image appear deeper and less washed out in bright, ambient light. But it can also reflect light-colored objects in the room like a mirror.  I can't use this monitor after sunset without getting a headache because the lamp behind me and/or my overhead light cast a glare that makes it very hard to see what I'm doing  The image is crisp, and I like that this monitor has a native 1080 resolution at 60 Hz.  I prefer a mouse, but the times I have used the touchscreen, it's been very responsive.  As with any inbuilt speakers (even on modern giant TVs), this monitor's speakers are lousy, but I've heard worse.  Any external speaker from the last 20 years will do a better job.  The backing on the monitor is its stand, being used to prop up the screen.  You can tilt the monitor more by pulling out the stand more, but you can't have the monitor completely upright, or it'll fall onto its face.  You can mount it on the wall (it complies to the international VESA standards), but that's impractical for my setup (and for most touchscreen setups, I reckon)."

R3Q68M67UZU1YA	547	3	"Let it be said first and foremost that I love the Nexus line and I have a Nexus phone (yes, Galaxy Nexus because the Nexus 5 is not on VZW)... I have also had the previous generation Nexus 7 and my husband has a 2012 Nexus 7 as well.<br /><br />Let me start out with the good.  The volume and screen resolution will blow you away if you were using the 2012 Nexus 7... which had a pretty nice screen, too; this one is exceptional.  This has extra space on the sides which I love to use to rest my thumbs while playing racing games or other games when I get a chance.  Most often, I find myself utilizing the tablet for Play Music while doing school, reading textbooks or books, Netflix for downtime, and the occasional aforementioned games.  I don't do a whole lot of internet browsing on it, just to look something up quick, etc. (Recommend Dolphin Browser, though).<br /><br />The tablet has done great until the KitKat update rolled out, when it started to do some boot looping, but nothing terrible, so I didn't mind much.  I like to experiment with different roms so I've had my fair share of bootlooping, but this tablet I kept BONE stock for the entire time I've owned it.  I figured there might be some issues when they gave a release date and blew past that by over three weeks to release to the Nexus crowd... which is one reason I buy Nexus products.  I like to have the latest OS.  I didn't fret over it though and figured they'd release it when it was right.  I was wrong.<br /><br />I have read on the forums sometimes where people had touchscreen issues or freezing, I did experience some of that as well, but I'd just sit it down to come back to it later when it could behave, or reboot it.  This came with the KitKat update.  Sometimes it's apps that are not yet ready for the update, so I went through and deleted everything non-essential, but the touchscreen &#34;freezing&#34; was still a problem.<br /><br />I also read some other things on the forums, which I dismissed as pure ridiculousness until a few days ago, when I found out firsthand that those ridiculous stories were true.  I am very careful with my devices and keep them in cases.  In this instance, I had just finished with a chapter of a book so I turned off my tablet and sat it down on the table.  Everyone in my house was sleeping.  I took a short break and came back to get my tablet before going to read in bed and finish another chapter.  The touchscreen wasn't responsive again, so I went ahead and rebooted.  It still wasn't working.  So I rebooted again and noticed a little spot in the center of my screen.  I turned on my bedside lamp only to find that it had hairline cracked across the screen and that part of the screen wouldn't be responding again.  Now I'm left with a tablet that only partially works due to only 1/8 of the screen working.<br /><br />Essentially, this tablet is amazing and I did love it until the KitKat rollout, at which time it became minority annoying.  I'm not saying that had anything to do with the touchscreen cracking, but that's where it went downhill first.  Now that I've read around a bit, I can't in good conscience recommend this tablet since it is a known issue, but obviously not a warranty item.  I don't blame people if they don't believe me, I was skeptical as well, but the screen cracking out of nowhere issue is very real.  I'm not sure what I'll buy next but it won't be another Nexus 7 FHD."
R3Q68M67UZU1YA	Eddie	4	"Let it be said first and foremost that I love the Nexus line and I have a Nexus phone (yes, Galaxy Nexus because the Nexus 5 is not on VZW)... I have also had the previous generation Nexus 7 and my husband has a 2012 Nexus 7 as well.<br /><br />Let me start out with the good.Ê The volume and screen resolution will blow you away if you were using the 2012 Nexus 7... which had a pretty nice screen, too; this one is exceptional.Ê This has extra space on the sides which I love to use to rest my thumbs while playing racing games or other games when I get a chance.Ê Most often, I find myself utilizing the tablet for Play Music while doing school, reading textbooks or books, Netflix for downtime, and the occasional aforementioned games.Ê I don't do a whole lot of internet browsing on it, just to look something up quick, etc. (Recommend Dolphin Browser, though).<br /><br />The tablet has done great until the KitKat update rolled out, when it started to do some boot looping, but nothing terrible, so I didn't mind much.Ê I like to experiment with different roms so I've had my fair share of bootlooping, but this tablet I kept BONE stock for the entire time I've owned it.Ê I figured there might be some issues when they gave a release date and blew past that by over three weeks to release to the Nexus crowd... which is one reason I buy Nexus products.Ê I like to have the latest OS.Ê I didn't fret over it though and figured they'd release it when it was right.Ê I was wrong.<br /><br />I have read on the forums sometimes where people had touchscreen issues or freezing, I did experience some of that as well, but I'd just sit it down to come back to it later when it could behave, or reboot it.Ê This came with the KitKat update.Ê Sometimes it's apps that are not yet ready for the update, so I went through and deleted everything non-essential, but the touchscreen &#34;freezing&#34; was still a problem.<br /><br />I also read some other things on the forums, which I dismissed as pure ridiculousness until a few days ago, when I found out firsthand that those ridiculous stories were true.Ê I am very careful with my devices and keep them in cases.Ê In this instance, I had just finished with a chapter of a book so I turned off my tablet and sat it down on the table.Ê Everyone in my house was sleeping.Ê I took a short break and came back to get my tablet before going to read in bed and finish another chapter.Ê The touchscreen wasn't responsive again, so I went ahead and rebooted.Ê It still wasn't working.Ê So I rebooted again and noticed a little spot in the center of my screen.Ê I turned on my bedside lamp only to find that it had hairline cracked across the screen and that part of the screen wouldn't be responding again.Ê Now I'm left with a tablet that only partially works due to only 1/8 of the screen working.<br /><br />Essentially, this tablet is amazing and I did love it until the KitKat rollout, at which time it became minority annoying.Ê I'm not saying that had anything to do with the touchscreen cracking, but that's where it went downhill first.Ê Now that I've read around a bit, I can't in good conscience recommend this tablet since it is a known issue, but obviously not a warranty item.Ê I don't blame people if they don't believe me, I was skeptical as well, but the screen cracking out of nowhere issue is very real.Ê I'm not sure what I'll buy next but it won't be another Nexus 7 FHD."

It works mostly fine - except for a couple tweaky things:<br /><br />1 - It is REALLY, REALLY hard to open. I'm hoping it will 'break in' a little, but I actually nicked my knuckle trying to open it.<br /><br />2 - You have to watch how you put the cards in the slots so you don't smash the foam. My CF cards JUST fit in each space, which is fine, but sometimes I wind up smooshing the foam edges a little, which might eventually wear down and cause the cards to not fit as nicely.<br /><br />All in all, I think it's built well, and does a fabulous job at protecting my memory cards. I just wish I wasn't afraid of injury every time I try to open it."

R3RBXNPS2R3HG1	547	3	"I use my note 8 mainly for work, at which I take a lot of notes.  I really enjoy the writing and pen feature of the device, but the battery life and the overall performance of the device makes me jealous of others that are at work who mainly have ipads or ipad mini's.  The overall user experience is a bit choppy.  Some apps that exist on both ipad and android tablets work smoother and faster on my colleagues' ipads (accessing hospital electronic medical records), and there just seems to be more support for the ipad versions of things than android.  This isn't a knock on all things android.  I like my device and plan to continue to purchase android devices (probably beyond Samsung now).  I just wish this device were snappier and the battery performance were better.  To give an example of the battery being poor, I've once unplugged my device at 6am after charging overnight, and by 10am, the battery was in the red after using the pen to write some notes for about 2 hours at 50% brightness.  It's a weird issue because it doesn't always happen, but does occur occasionally.<br /><br />The overall feel that I'm getting with this device is like when I first bought a Galaxy S1 (Verizon Fascinate) and felt that it lagged behind the iphone version at that time but after upgrading to the Galaxy S3, the device felt much improved and much more on-par with the iphone version at the time of the S3 release."

R3RDZAE1G70OGM	547	2	"This computer was amazing for the price and very convenient as a nursing student to take with me to class. My only complaint is that the start button only works when it feels like it, once my desktop got turned black from some bug? (That's what I read), sometimes it won't change landscapes when you turn it upright, once my mouse stopped working completely (figured out that there is a button that disables it on the keyboard), it takes forever to charge and the cord is so short, and once soon after I got it it wouldn't turn on and had to hold power button for awhile. The power life is amazing though. That is one thing I love about it. Lasts a good 8 hours. To me all of these are simple little glitches that could be fixed, but although they are annoying, doesn't interfere with what I need it to do. Love the tablet and computer two in one. Sorry for the long review and I would still recommend this to students especially. Very affordable as well."

R3S7HJ8DRISXY	547	2	"First, I can say that this is the best bluetooth interface to my stereo system that I can find at a reasonable price.  It is simple and easy to setup so that I can feed music to my stereo or listen to it wirelessly.    I stream music to this device from my ipod bluetooth interface (A125s).  I listen to music from my stereo via this device using my bluetooth headset (BT620s).  This device paired easily and consistently keep the pairings.  Connection to the A125s dropped occasionally during music playing but only for a short time and not enough to be annoying yet.    Now, for the bad part.  The audio lag is very noticeable and is at a varying amount.  This make playing games like Guitar Hero almost impossible if you are keeping rhythm by listening to the music.  On GH4 (World Tour), there is an audio calibration that can help compensate for the lag but I still have problem due to fluctuation in the delay.  GH3 has no such calibration so I can't play any songs beyond the easy mode when using this device.    I should note here that the audio lag may be a common problem with all bluetooth audio devices.  There are three devices in the loop here (my stereo system, the bluetooth gateway and the bluetooth headphone) and each of them probably contributes to this problem in someway.    Overall, it is a good device to have.  The audio lag is a big let down for me but for others, this issue is probably not a big deal."

R3ULIRBHM2IHZ0	547	3	This keyboard works OK to some degree with its limited number of features. It has one major flaw - it can only be used on a desktop. It is inconceivable that no provision is available to secure the tablet to the keyboard. The tablet simply sits in a keyboard slot where the slightest nudge will dislodge it with the very real possibility of falling and becoming damaged. I use a PC at home and purchased this tablet and keyboard to take on the road to various events such as the Georgia International Horse park to watch the horses do their thing. I also expected to be able to place it in a shopping cart such as at a grocery store where I can see my shopping list. No can do.<br /><br />If all you need is a firm desktop space on which to set down your tablet and if you do not require hardly any convenient features then this may be right down your alley. But if you plan to use it on the road then it would be to your advantage to get a better keyboard.

I had missed the sound and love the feel of it.<br /><br />I have one CON,  Arrow Key gamers beware;  You are able to use up and left or up and right to move forward and strafe, however, moving forward while strafing is the only thing you can do with the buttons near the arrow keys.  While pressing both up and left or both up and right, no other (3rd simultaneous key press) button works.  They work fine individually or if you are only moving forward, or only strafing, but you cannot move forward, strafe, and hit another key at the same time.  For this reason i have dropped it two stars because i feel doing these actions is important for my gaming and I was quite disappointed when i found I was limited in this.  I just wish i had kept the box so i could return this keyboard for one that will work for my button combinations.<br /><br />Other than the one con listed above, I love this keyboard and will probably use it for a work computer or one of the boys school keyboards."

R9SLRMQ82MAEN	547	2	I misplaced my unifying reciever for my logitech keyboard that worked flawlessly with my android phone. This one would not pair without a driver download which is not available for android. Im sure it would have worked if I was a little more computer savvy. Im sure this works fine with all products by logitech. Just be aware of this if you only use for an android device.the return shipping is over half what the product is worth so it was just wasted money unfortunately.  Things like this will make me shop a little tighter on amazon for that very reason. Not everything is a free of cost return.

RAEYELT62H5I3	547	2	"I bought this only because at the time of this review my Logitech keyboard no longer works with the Android 5.0.2 update. The Samsung keyboard works fine. The keys are a bit better than the Logitech. My biggest complaint is that I don't like the design where the tablet essentially just sits on the keyboard. It is nicer that the whole unit is thinner than when used with the Logitech keyboard but, I liked how the tablet securely fitted into the Logitech keyboard much better. This keyboard will work for now but, should a patch ever be put out to allow the Logitech keyboards to work again I will be switching back and this one will go in the closet."

RAGGG39MTMUSP	547	2	"I was disappointed that the eSATA interface on this drive did not work. The USB interface worked fine, and would have been OK if I was willing to settle for the slower interface provided by USB 2.0 vs the higher speed of eSATA. Instead of returning the drive, I removed the hard drive from the Fantom case and installed it in my computer as a second SATA drive. The drive itself works fine, and provides the performance you expect of a SATA II drive. Since the price of the Fantom GreenDrive was low enough, it was worthwhile to use the 2 TB SATA drive contained within the Fantom enclosure in my computer. I plan to use this enclosure in the future with another SATA drive as a USB 2.0 external hard drive, where performance is not critical. However, it is really not acceptable that this unit does not perform per spec out of the box. Any buyer of this external hard drive should be prepared to return it if either of the two interfaces does not work."

RAGT1Q5ZHA4U7	547	3	"I bought an Apple Thunderbolt and realized that it was not working with my Macbook pro 2010 (bought my laptop late 2010 and Thunderbolt only works with newer versions of the Macbook pro). While searching on Amazon I noticed the great reviews for this product. The main issue I am having problem with is that I do not seem to have full control on the color adjustment. Somehow my laptop sitting next to this monitor is having livelier colors. I spent hours trying to match the color but just does not work, so color calibration was an issue for me and so the colors on the monitor is not as warm as I would like it and I have learned to live with it. There are options such as ECO and DCR that helps but it is a on/off which does not help me. I have to mention that if I were to use this monitor with a computer, I would not have as much issue with the color. I think connection to the monitor is what is causing issues.<br /><br />The stand is not really sturdy and small hits against the monitor makes the monitor shake but I think for the price it is supposed to be as good as it gets.<br /><br />Overall, if Thunderbolt worked with my laptop, I would have gone with that but as a 2nd choice, this is a good monitor, it was in fact better than all the major brands I saw online on Amazon. The customer service is amazing. I bought it first and the monitor was not working. The seriously helpful support engineer at Nixeus drove from LA to my office in OC to figure it out. Turned out it was the STAR TEC cable I got from amazon and of course he had a cable with him that gave me for free, so one thing with this monitor you do not have to worry about is the customer and support service."

You have to turn off bluetooth mode, reboot the keyboard, turn bluetooth mode back on and re-pair the kindle and keyboard.  I find this extremely frustrating - I don't know that I would have chosen this case/keyboard had I known this would be an issue. The keyboard is not compatible with some of the apps I use which have chat - also frustrating but not a huge problem.

The Kindle touch downloads books quickly and the response time for new menus and pages is great.  It is also is very user friendly, setting up an account to purchase books so easy and registering the kindle was simple. There are so many free books and excellent novels under $1.00.  However I wonder if I bought the right Kindle for me.  1st complaint is that I can't read in bed (no backlight)  2nd complaint is that I bought the Kindle with the Offers and Sponsored Screensavers and find that kind of annoying.  I haven't decided if it is worth putting up with the annoyance as it is $30 cheaper than a Kindle touch without the offers.  I understand that I can opt out of the Screensavers and that Amazon will kindly charge me $30 dollars.  3rd complaint is that the text to speech feature is poor as the computer generated voice frequently mispronounces words and doesn't seem to know much about punctuation.  My final complaint is about the audio books.  They are very expensive and do not allow you to follow along with the story as it is being read.  So yes I like the Kindle, but there are many improvements that can be made."

RDRHH75QJS3HL	547	4	"I wanted to use this keyboard with more than one device, pairing as needed.  The first inconvenience is the pairing button is one of those that you need to use a pen or toothpick to press, or paper clip.  Those kind of buttons are not meant to use routinely and are very inconvenient, especially since the power button is positioned so you do not accidentally push it so why not make the pairing button easier to use while not being in the way?    I was able to pair this back and forth about 10 times, and now the pairing button doesn't do anything no matter how long I push it in or what I use.  I can push harder with a pin or try different pokers but that would only break it more.  Luckily the pairing button broke with the keyboard paired with my computer I actually wanted to use it with.  Another issue is the folding keyboard doesn't seem to be stay flat if in your lap because it folds, but that could be my fault not knowing how to lock it but didn't see how to make it lock in the open position.    All that said it works great once paired and if you have a flat surface to use it on."

The case is sturdy, and it grips the iPad tightly so that it won't pop out (a problem with my previous Logitech case).  This keyboard has great funtionality and is a bit easier to type on than the Logitech Ultrathin Folio.  The backlight feature on the keyboard is very nice, including the choice of colors.  In terms of design, the only disadvantage for me compared to the Logitech is that the Zagg case cannot be folded back on itself to allow easy holding of the iPad for reading.  However, I quickly got used to holding my iPad like an open book, so this downside did not outweigh the good things about the case.  BUT, the show-stopper for me on this case is that it is completey unreliable on bluetooth connectivity.  I read in some other posts that this was an issue, but I thought it might be an occasional issue.  For me, every time I opened the case to use it, I had to Forget/Re-pair the device to my iPad, and on a few occasions, even that did not work.  That is enough to drive me batty, so I have sent this case back.  However, if Zagg and Apple ever get this bug fixed, I will definitely purchase this item again."

RG6V1WQIYAOEF	547	4	"I bought a Speck case for my 2010 MBP.  A couple of weeks later, I bought an Incase hardshell, and sold the Speck case.  The price was about $20 more for the Incase, but it was well worth it and I'll explain why.      There are a couple of issues with the Speck case.  First, the Macbook Pro uses the aluminum as a way to dissipate heat.  That is why the bottom of the case gets hot.  That's also why the MBP is so quiet, because it doesn't need 3-4 fans like a PC laptop.  People that complain about the bottom of the MBP getting hot seem to not understand this key concept.  On the bottom of the Speck case, you can see prefabbed slots that are there for ventilation.  However, only the slots on the left corner are \\""drilled\\"" all the way through.  This makes no sense.  Yes, the left back side of the MBP does get hotter, but why have prefabbed holes etched in the plastic, but only have 25% of them actually usable?      Second, the bottom part of the Speck case attaches in 4 places.  When you look at your MBP upright, and in use, the Speck will clip onto the front left and right sides next to the palmrest areas.  The Speck case also clips at the back right and left corners.  That's great and it's fine if you have a 13\\"", but on a 15\\"" when you flip over your MBP and look at the Speck case attached to the MBP there most likely will be \\""bowing\\"" along the whole backside where the hinge is.  Plenty of dust and debris can creep up between the Speck case and the bottom of the MBP. The fit is just not snug.    Incase on the other hand solves both of these problems.  Incase has vents that go across the ENTIRE bottom/backside.  Therefore the MBP can vent properly.  Second, the Incase bottom doesn't clip on the back corners, instead it's got one large clip that clips across the entire hinge on the back of the MBP.  This eliminates the \\""bowing\\"" and thus makes the bottom of the case fit better than Speck.    Another thing, the rubber feet on the Speck case are made of plastic.  When you'reusing your MBP on a smooth surface, it will slide around.  The Incase has rubber feet.  I haven't had any issues with my MBP sliding around (I put it on a Ikea laptop stand that I can bend at a 30 degree angle, and it still stays put).    One last thing.  The inside of the Speck case is rough and the one I ordered had a few sharp pieces of plastic that weren't shaved down.  I had to sand them down for fear of scratching the metal of my MBP.  Incase on the other hand has a smooth surface on the inside which is the same as the surface on the outside.      Yes Incase cost a bit more, but trust me (I've had both), it's well worth the extra investment."

The fit is just not snug.Ê Ê Incase on the other hand solves both of these problems.Ê Incase has vents that go across the ENTIRE bottom/backside.Ê Therefore the MBP can vent properly.Ê Second, the Incase bottom doesn't clip on the back corners, instead it's got one large clip that clips across the entire hinge on the back of the MBP.Ê This eliminates the \\""bowing\\"" and thus makes the bottom of the case fit better than Speck.Ê Ê Another thing, the rubber feet on the Speck case are made of plastic.Ê When you'reusing your MBP on a smooth surface, it will slide around.Ê The Incase has rubber feet.Ê I haven't had any issues with my MBP sliding around (I put it on a Ikea laptop stand that I can bend at a 30 degree angle, and it still stays put).Ê Ê One last thing.Ê The inside of the Speck case is rough and the one I ordered had a few sharp pieces of plastic that weren't shaved down.Ê I had to sand them down for fear of scratching the metal of my MBP.Ê Incase on the other hand has a smooth surface on the inside which is the same as the surface on the outside.Ê Ê Ê Yes Incase cost a bit more, but trust me (I've had both), it's well worth the extra investment."
RGB9NE4ITY8VZ	547	4	"I'm being nitpicky, but I feel I have the right to be with a $200 product.<br /><br />Overall the device works very well. Battery lasts for a very long time, screen is easy to read, plenty of brightness settings to find that perfect light wherever you are, plenty of room to store many books. I love no longer needing to use a book light, I was chewing through CR2032 batteries at a tremendous rate. Prime lender's library is a nice bonus, if it weren't for the 1-book-a-month limitation, but I digress....<br /><br />My biggest complaint is a lack of physical page-turn buttons. I frequently switch off my \\""holding\\"" hand, and with my previous e-reader, a Nook Simple Touch, there were physical buttons on both sides that allowed me to turn pages one-handed no matter which hand was holding the device. Not so with the Kindle Paperwhite. If I'm holding with my right, no problem, if I've switched to my left I have to bring my right hand up to page turn.<br /><br />While I've read hundred of paper books, obviously, and dealt with this in the past, you can say I'm being overly picky.<br /><br />The device is also incredibly difficult to hold comfortably, I have very large hands, but the finish doesn't have much friction and the bezel is very small, my thumb is quite a bit thicker. If it wasn't for the case my wife ordered with it, which has a hand-strap behind it, I would've returned this immediately because I just cannot hold it comfortably one handed without the case.<br /><br />Special Offers cannot be removed with a gift card. I'm glad my card on file was invalid and my payment didn't go through when I tried, but I was annoyed I couldn't remove them with a giftcard.<br /><br />The library is very annoying to navigate through. I have upwards of 300 books on my device, and it takes me a very, very long time to get through them. For whatever reason, I cannot get my library to sort by Author's Last Name, my library was imported from my Nook, using Calibre to move everything to .mobi, and I've embedded author sort in the files. Lack of physical buttons to navigate the library often causes the device to register a short swipe as a tap, and opens a book it thinks I tapped on, rather than swiping through the library.<br /><br />The device needs frequent restarting. It seems to have memory problems (physical device memory) and slows down, much like a computer with a memory leak that's left on too long. Frequently it will lag for 1-10 seconds on page turn.

Research lead me to find it's very common and the glow screen is horrendously delicate. I settled on the Kindle because I read the Kindle developers actually abuse-tested the screen to make sure it could take an average tap without breaking.

There is definitely an intermittent power issue with the device I ordered, as it was refurbished and may have made it past QA due to it being an intermittent issue. I contacted Amazon support and immediately received a refund and return label. I don't think this is a reflection of EMBIZ as it could have been overlooked if the device wasn't tested for very long.

RL1VRCSI33A84	547	3	"I bought this adapter as a replacement for my daughter's L355-S7915 Toshiba laptop.  The original adapter had come apart at the edge of the stress relief for the laptop plug.  This one works perfectly fine to charge the laptop, but, despite being listed as a replacement for this laptop, it isn't what I would have chosen to use if I'd seen it in person before purchasing.  This is because, while the actual connector itself fits the laptop, and the adapter does charge the laptop as well as the old, the plastic shield around the connector is not the same diameter as the original.  It is actually smaller.  This is a problem because that plastic barrel fits into the outer edge of the laptop case's charging port, providing a snug fit that keeps the plug firmly in place.  With the smaller size of this replacement's connector, it actually wiggles around in the opening when plugged, and may be placing excess stress on the actual electrical connector inside the laptop.  Further, care has to be taken that it doesn't simply fall out of the laptop, as only the electrical connector is holding it in place, unlike with the factory original power supply plug.<br /><br />So, it works as intended to charge this laptop, and is relatively inexpensive. But it doesn't fit very securely into the laptop's charging port, so care must be taken when using it to ensure it stays connected and that the port doesn't become damaged."

RLIQYZ3ZDPK1S	547	3	"I purchased this case for my new iPad mini 3 gold. Although it is beautiful and fits perfectly, it is also very heavy and truly adds too much bulk- taking away from the purpose and appeal of an iPad mini. If the primary purpose of your iPad mini is to be at home and for convenience, then this case works great. It's pretty, durable and functional. However, if you need it to protect your iPad but also be sleek and light (which is what I was looking for as I use this on rounds in the hospital and place it in my white coat pocket), then this case is not for you."

RLWTQIVC7KKZR	547	2	"I did tons of research on this unit before I decided to purchase it. From what I learned, I would be taking a gamble on the quality of how the product was made. I wanted something in the $50 price range with good sound, especially in the bass department. When i received the unit it looked good cosmeticly. I hooked everything up and powered the sub. Worked for about one minute before the left speaker went out. I tested all the connections, equalizer on the Pc and connected an Ipod to be sure I had successfully diagnosed the issue. I decided to remove the back panel to examine for any damage in the hardware. Since it was only $50 I did not care about taking the risk with voiding any warranty. I discovered a loose wire connector on the audio input connectors. Tightened the connetion and reassembled. It has worked great for going on three days now. Movies, videogames and music all sound really good on the unit. The base is surprisingly attractive and it has great range of sound as others reviewed. Im happy with my purchase!"

RN8N0UR7GTB2D	547	2	"Overall, the bag is ok: no bad stitching or broken parts. The design is not so great. The only part that truly closes is the little zipper pocket on the outside. You have to be careful not to put anything small, loose and valuable inside the main bag, because it's just dividers in there. Also be careful the flap is secured to the straps. Stuff can easily fall out if the bag goes upside down. My other gripe is that it's really closer to 16&#34; wide. I wanted it just to hold my new iPad Air 2 but it's plenty big enough for a laptop... I feel like I'm totting  luggage. I was looking for a purse substitute that would hold a tablet, phone and my personal stuff ( wallet, lipstick, etc) but this isn't it. Too big and no zippers inside. Way bigger than 13&#34; wide."

ROGH03V94FD51	547	3	"Bought this unit back in Feb 2013 and had been using it with both a 2.5 and a 3.5 SATA drive inserted. I really only used the 2.5 SATA drive for data and left the 3.5 drive alone as a maintenance drive, only intending to use it for data swapping and such. one year later I started to use the 3.5 drive slot and started to lose data on transferring to that drive. Being stupid, I blamed the WD Drive first. Duh, it was the 3.5 inch drive slot not the Hard Drive. The small cable connection that hooks between the 2.5 slot and the 3.5 slot is ugly, cheap and the pins are bendy and just terrible. It's just the power connection, but not good looking. The drive passes all the SMART tests, but will not format in that slot. The vendor really needs to upgrade the material. As others have mentioned, replace the PLASTIC handles and key locks with metal and upgrade the connectors and cables. You have a good design, just bad material. Would buy again at a higher price if these upgrades were added. I am going to remove the whole thing and go back into the case."

I had been using a laptop with internet connection sharing, plugged into my router. But then the laptop had to on 24/7 plugged into the router.   So far on the cradlepoint Ive gotten slightly faster d/l speeds than on the laptop using with verizon access manager, as high as 212k/second connecting at 3G, I never got over about 180k before. Our home is just outside 4G coverage. I can't comment on the built-in wireless, I have it disabled since I already have a wireless N network with GB wired, so I am basically using this for a USB modem to ethernet adapter.   Set up and configuration only took about 2 minutes, but remember it's easier to write down you default password off the bottom before you hook it up and plug it in.  Update: Now Ive had it for a week it's not as great. I have to keep rebooting it once a day or more, the internet will totally stop but according to the router, it's working fine. Only way to get it working is unplug it or reboot it from the management page. When I had the same modem on a laptop, it worked fine, never lost connection or had to reboot."

RPILL5CUDHTRX	547	2	"I'm really confused by all these 5 star reviews. I had high hopes for these and love the way they look. I've heard the A5s and loved those, but they were too big for my desktop, so I thought these would be a smaller but have somewhat of a similar sound. I gave them a solid 2 weeks of listening for several hours a day, and the more I listened to them, the more I disliked them. With a very clear recording, like a piano or acoustic guitar turned up really loud, these sound great. But that can only be said for a very specific kind of track, for all others the sound is very average. I would compare the sound to an average 2.1 system with the subwoofer off. The sound is very flat and directional, you have to be right in the sweet spot to hear them at their prime. Most recordings sound like a tin can, and there's almost no bass at all. They aren't room filling at all, and they distort very quickly if you try to crank them. I wasn't looking to rattle any windows, but like to turn them up from time to time. Although I use these as desktop speakers, I do like to listen to them while doing other things as well, which these are really bad for. The sound at loud volumes can be harsh, it sounds like they are working really hard to hit those volumes, reminded me of a cheap boom box. I set these up next to several other speakers at this price point, and found these were some of the worst sounding of the bunch."

Pretty much unplayable.<br /><br />I was extremely disappointed with this laptop and strongly considered returning it. I didn't, but I can't help thinking if I'd spent the money on the intel/nvidia option I'd have been a bit happier."
RR0Z311HHOBMY	547	1	Neat product. Doesn't hold its connection real well with my LG bluetooth headphones though.    Edit:  The folks at Plugable contacted me immediately to see if they could help resolve my issue from above.  Sam sent out a replacement product and it works flawlessly.  Stellar customer service that is above and beyond what you could hope for from such a small company.  Buy with confidence from Sam and his crew.  They're the real deal.

RR11RNWCRJ332	547	1	"This mount is plenty heavy duty for the two 22 inch monitors I have attached.  It's fairly easy to make quick, minor adjustments, but the entire system (not the post on which the arms attach) hangs to the one side with no way to properly adjust or compensate.  It's functional as is, but every time I sit/stand at my adjustable height desk, my OCD begs for me to figure out a way to straighten the monitor arms."

RT5BS3Q8LYWDH	547	5	"Unlike the other reviewer, my case was assembled straight and perfect.  The mini fits in this case perfectly and it looks awesome, but IMO there are two flaws.  The first is no biggy, but still a concern.  The magnet for the screen auto on and off is not powerful enough.  Don't get me wrong, it does turn it off and on, but I can hear it clicking on and off just carrying it around.  It also like to flop open on it's own.  A more powerful magnet would make a huge difference.  I also have another case(not from Spigen) with the auto on/off feature that works perfect!  The cover stays tight to the screen unless you want it to open.<br /><br />Now, for the real flaw in this case, the rubber doohicky that lets you prop this case open to create a stand.  I'm talking about the oval shaped rubber piece on the inside of the front cover.  Don't get me wrong, it works as intended, but I am concerned about the long term effects on the screen and/or screen protector.  Almost immediately I noticed it leaving marks on my screen because the cover rests on the screen mostly on this rubber piece when the case is closed.  I have a Spigen screen protector that will save my iPad, but that $18 screen protector is going to get damaged by this rubber snubber in short order.  I would REALLY be afraid to use this case with a bare glass screen.  I have actually thought about cutting the little rubber off because the look and design of this case is awesome, but for now I'm not using it because of my concern for my screen.  This little rubber piece puts all of the pressure and wear from the front cover onto one small area, and that's no good.  Spigen, please change the design of this case.  All it needs is a little thicker cover with indentation slots on the inside front cover for the pad to rest in when it is propped up and a stronger magnet.  Those two corrections and you make the PERFECT case.<br /><br />I have a number of Spigen products and most are awesome, but this one needs work.  As I said, it fits and looks great, but its function is sub par.  This is a five star product for looks and quality with a two star deduction for functionality flaws. I really wanted it to be the perfect case, but it just isn't. Fix it and trade me for the revised product and I'll be happy to change this review!"

According to the user's manual pg.12 (Does not support ...and resolutions, standard for 2K and 4K digital cinema resolution.), this monitor, although comes with an HDMI 1.4 version, eliminates its crucial optional spec. In other words, HDMI input on 2560x1440 @ 60Hz is made impossible even though you have an hdmi 1.4 cable + 1.4 graphics card. Admittedly, although some tweaks that manually setting the resolution to 1440p would work @30Hz or even up to 55Hz, those may not be applied to everyone and could hardly provide much satisfaction. Hence, a second thought is required for potential buyers with *only* HDMI ports and cables. I am questioning the Dell's logic behind not supporting this very important optional feature yet still literally claiming it's HDMI 1.4, as well as hiding this unremarkable yet important information. Peers, such as Asus's pb278q(r), an 'old' 2012 model, have no problem with 2k under hdmi."

RX8Z6RLDZS4YK	547	2	"I just received this today and tried it out. Immediately I could tell the construction of this case is excellent. The leather feels nice, and the added elastic band on the back is a good touch to allow you to slip your hand in and keep grasp of the case/tab.  The Galaxy Tab badge on the side of the case cool. On the inside there's two credit card sized slots for an ID card of a \\""return to address if lost\\"" tag. And that's about it.<br /><br />Now with the most important part.  This case, although recommended by Amazon for the Tab 2 7in,  I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS FOR  GALAXY TAB 2 7.0 OWNERS! I think it only is compatible for the 1st gen Galaxy Tabs.<br /><br />The tab doesn't fit correctly; some of the tab is exposed on the left because it doesn't go in all the way. The fabric that holds the tab in doesn't have the correct cut-outs for the Tab 2. The top portion completely covers the mic and headphone jack. The volume button is covered on the upper/high volume portion, thus keeping pressure on the high volume button.  Even though I don't use the Peel app and the IR, it's completely covered as well.  The bottom speakers aren't aligned correctly. And lastly, the light sensor is completely covered also, so if auto brightness is on, will always dim the screen to adjust to low light situations.<br /><br />Again, this case would be excellent for the original Galaxy Tab 7 first generation, BUT NOT FOR THE GALAXY TAB 2 7.0"

The leather feels nice, and the added elastic band on the back is a good touch to allow you to slip your hand in and keep grasp of the case/tab.Ê The Galaxy Tab badge on the side of the case cool. On the inside there's two credit card sized slots for an ID card of a \\""return to address if lost\\"" tag. And that's about it.<br /><br />Now with the most important part.Ê This case, although recommended by Amazon for the Tab 2 7in,Ê I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS FORÊ GALAXY TAB 2 7.0 OWNERS! I think it only is compatible for the 1st gen Galaxy Tabs.<br /><br />The tab doesn't fit correctly; some of the tab is exposed on the left because it doesn't go in all the way. The fabric that holds the tab in doesn't have the correct cut-outs for the Tab 2. The top portion completely covers the mic and headphone jack. The volume button is covered on the upper/high volume portion, thus keeping pressure on the high volume button.Ê Even though I don't use the Peel app and the IR, it's completely covered as well.Ê The bottom speakers aren't aligned correctly. And lastly, the light sensor is completely covered also, so if auto brightness is on, will always dim the screen to adjust to low light situations.<br /><br />Again, this case would be excellent for the original Galaxy Tab 7 first generation, BUT NOT FOR THE GALAXY TAB 2 7.0"

RXC5LRUZ605DC	547	3	"This is a good product - nevertheless...<br /><br />...when used as a range extender the Almond must be placed in a location that has a strong signal - the Almond will extend the signal it receives, but will not boost a weak signal - the instructions allude to this, stating the extender must be a reasonable distance from the router.<br /><br />Also, keep in mind the signal it extends is susceptible to degradation by walls or other obstructions that may be the origin of the need to extend in the first place.<br /><br />The bottom line is the user must place the Almond in just the right spot - this may be easy, or, in some instances, may be impossible."

RXIPOMVOKZFUX	547	3	"I got these speakers to replace an older set that failed.  The sound quality is OK for the price.  The power supply is in the right speaker, there is no external power brick, and the AC cord goes straight into the speaker.  I have a traditional CRT monitor, not the LCD flat panel, and the power supply in the right speaker generates enough of a magnetic field to interfere with the CRT display, causing distortion.  I swapped the speakers with my other computer, which has a flat panel LCD monitor and they work fine.   Don't get these if you use a CRT and want to place the speakers within 12 inches of the monitor."

RXJRHLU1EGHXD	547	1	"I purchased this item thinking that it would be a small, pocketable device.  (As of this posting, there are no measurements included in the details section of the seller's page, so I assumed it was about the size of a regular USB.)  When it arrived, it was HUGE -- easily four times as big as I'd been expecting.  As a rough estimate, think &#34;almost the size of two golf balls&#34; big.<br /><br />Apart from the sizing issue, it looks like it does in the picture, and I'm sure it functions fine (though if you're on a laptop where the USB port is close to the table/desk, the width of the cork could get in the way of plugging it in).  However, I will be sending it back in favor of getting something smaller."

RXYUR7NSCBFGR	547	1	I received this case today. I was told this is a temp case due to they had a problem with the magnet when case folded backwards it puts the nexus 7 back to sleep. This seems to be a great case except for that one problem. They are suppose to be sending me a new improved case that works and leaves the nexus 7 on when case is folded backwards while using the tablet. I will post an update when it arrives and let all know how it is<br /><br />Thanks<br />Brent

RYF9OEN2IFPDO	547	3	"I like this backpack, it is sweet. But it is definitely different than it is pictured in the listing. If you like the spiky front part of the backpack, read no more, just buy it, it's pretty good. But if you're expecting a nicely padded back panel and straps with nice hardware, do not buy this.<br /><br />It is pictured with layers of mesh and leatherette and padding on the back panel, and what I got is just a layer of leatherette with no padding. The straps look all beefy and like they would protect your body from discomfort, with two sets of d-rings on each strap, a strap that buckles across the chest, a strap that buckles across the waist, and two plastic grippy adjustable slides for the strap length. This backpack is not even big enough to fit all of that hardware on it. What I got: non-padded leatherette straps with metal d-rings to adjust strap length, and the webbing was flimsy and non-finished (slightly melted at the ends to prevent unraveling, but not sewn over in any way.<br /><br />The side pockets look like they do on the listing, and there is an inner pocket in the backpack, which are both nice. Also, the pack is kind of small, but I do think that is reflected in the description of the product. This pack retains points for how badass and awesome it is despite being so different from the pictured listing."

RZJZ0B0P34N1P	547	2	The case is good. It is not great but it does it's job. I went with this case instead of the amazon brand to save a few more bucks. I never used the amazon brand but from what I can tell the only difference is that the amazon case puts your tablet to sleep automatically.<br />Now for this case's review.<br />Pro's:<br />- decent stand for watching videos on tablet.<br />- minimal - average protection (not an otterbox)<br />- little flap on the side to hold stylus pen<br /><br />Con's:<br />- Quality: poor - average. I wouldn't expect it to last past two years.<br />- suede inside sometimes picks up dust and puts it on the screen.<br /><br />* Mainly knocked off 2 stars (1 1/2 in my head) due to the quality and durability.

RZNKLZ6E4IFX8	547	2	Product is great for HDD and flash drive combination when using with a tablet such as Surface Pro 3.  Tablet port doesn't have enough juice to support two HDDs.  Maybe the installation of a power port from another USB port or power source would make this a 5-star product.

RZQP6SHYIK9W0	547	2	"I bought this to replace an internal PCI card on my RHEL-clone 5.5 Linux PC,  which uses a 2.6.18 Linux kernel.    Unfortunately the drivers in this kernel don't fully work for this device;  it's recognized and you can set the WEP encryption keys, but not the SSID.    I tried it with my Knoppix Linux DVD (with a 2.6.31 kernel) and it comes up  without a problem and all parameters can be configured with standard wireless  tools like iwconfig.    So this is a great solution if you need a USB-ethernet adapter for a recent Linux  kernel but not for the more widespread Linux distributions like RHEL 5.5 which  are still on 2.6.18."
